title: Luck

<p>
While driving home from work today I realized I have always been wrong about something. I don't believe in luck anymore. For a long time I thought that some people were lucky and some people were unfortunate. But it occurred to me that all people are equal. Those who look for good things to happen to them usually find them, and people who look for bad things to happen to them are never disappointed.

<p>Nobody is charmed and nobody is cursed. </p>
<p>I don't know why that didn't occur to me before, but it's actually affected me enough that I wanted to write it down.</p>
