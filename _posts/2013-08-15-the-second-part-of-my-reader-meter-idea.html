<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mijustin">@mijustin</a> asked me via Twitter what the incentive (beyond just being a patron of stuff you like) would be for people to sign up inthe first place <a href="http://torrez.org/the-reader-meter.html">to my idea I posted about</a> a week ago.</p>

<p>It’s a good question and I do have another idea that would fit well within Readerkit so I am going to tell it to you now.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://mlkshk.com/">MLKSHK</a>, the site my wife and I created a few years back, there is a little banner that shows up between posts where you last started reading:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/112g3f0d3U0y2c1B291L/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-15%20at%201.45.38%20PM.png" width="395" height="212"></p>

<p>It is created when you first view your incoming stream and displays the timesince it was created:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/282M2y1a0X13051P1H47/Screen%20Shot%202013-08-15%20at%201.54.55%20PM.png" width="500" height="275"></p>

<p>You can use it to “jump” back to where you previously started and work yourway forward.</p>

<p>It is an automatically generated bookmark that is inserted in between posts so you can determine where you last left off reading so you can be sure to catch up with every post.</p>

<p>I could see the initial sell to readers would be: “sign-up and get this handy bookmark generated for you”.</p>

<p>Readerkit could also send out a monthly “Here are posts you might not haveseen” along with the bill described in my last post.</p>

<p>The only requirement would be the site’s publisher would have to insert a special DIV and JavaScript into their template so Readerkit could render thebanners and links.</p>

<p>So there are two ideas for you.</p>
