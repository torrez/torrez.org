<p>Patrick Smith <a href="http://jetlagged.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/the-airport-security-follies/index.html">writes an excellent piece in the NY Times</a> about the state of airport security. You might remember Patrick has a column in Salon called "<a href="http://dir.salon.com/topics/ask_the_pilot/">Ask The Pilot</a>" and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ask-Pilot-Patrick-Smith/dp/1594480044/nutshell-20">a book</a> by the same name. </p>

<p>If you're a nervous flier I can't recommend his book enough. Ever since I read it flights have been much more enjoyable and easy to get through. </p>

<p>Security not so much.</p>
