<p>I socked away the Joe Ades, vegetable peeler, story after seeing him <a href="http://kottke.org/08/09/nycs-eccentric-vegetable-peeler-salesman">discussed on blogs</a> a year or so ago. Jason was the first to tell me about his <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/02/rip-joe-ades">recent death</a>, and I enjoyed reading <a href="http://davidgalbraith.org/uncategorized/the-joe-ades-myth-deconstructed/1666/">David Galbraith's</a> corrections and insight on who Joe really was, but <strong>do not miss</strong> Dave Pell's <a href="http://davenetics.com/2009/02/peeling-cucumbers-on-the-front-stoop/">very nicely written</a> post about Joe. </p>

<p>I love when a relatively small event like the death of Joe Ades, seems to dislodge a flood of things in a writer's mind. </p>
