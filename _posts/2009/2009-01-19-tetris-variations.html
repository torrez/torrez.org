<p>I had forgotten David had posted a wish for a Tetris variation he called Montris. <a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2009/01/i_wrote_it_you_made_it_montris.html">Someone actually produced a proof-of-concept for him</a>.</p>

<p>Here is my wish for a Tetris variation: I call it Slowtris and the only difference between an actual game of Tetris and Slowtris is the pieces don't fall. The fun in the game is just figuring out where to put things. </p>

<p>Well it sounds fun to <em>me</em>.</p>
