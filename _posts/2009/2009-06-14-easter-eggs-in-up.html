<p><a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2009/05/31/easter-eggs-in-pixars-up/">A whole lot of Easter Eggs in Pixar's <em>Up</em></a>. I finally saw the movie so now I'm reading old reviews and opinions. I loved the first 30 minutes but I surprised myself by not loving the rest of it. Maybe I need to see it again?</p>
