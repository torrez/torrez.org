<p>No two snowflakes are alike? <a href="http://www.idsgn.org/posts/no-two-snowflakes-alike/">Not so fast.</a> Now I can't UNSEE that snowflake, I'm going to see it everywhere. Just like <a href="http://www.theginblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/marioclouds.jpg">the clouds/bushes in Super Mario Brothers</a>.</p>

<p><em>Found via <a href="http://coudal.com/">Coudal</a>, who by the way, runs such a fantastic link blog I tend to never repost stuff from their feed because I figure everyone reads them. But if you don't, you should start.</em></p>
