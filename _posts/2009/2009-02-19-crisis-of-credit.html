title: Crisis of Credit
category: Current Affairs

<p>While I think this animation is good, and it helps illustrate the flow of money and greediness of everyone involved, I think the This American Life episode "Giant Pool of Money" did a better job in pointing out not every risky buyer was trying to get away with something. Here they are drawn as overweight, tattooed, smoking, and having too many kids to suggest them as "risky"â€¦ Whereas the TAL episode detailed the predatory nature of the lenders actively searching for people who shouldn't have been looking to buy a house.</p>

<p>Still, I think the video is worth watching. </p>
