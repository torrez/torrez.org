<p>I had this idea almost 4 years ago and since my New Year's resolution is build it or let the domain expire, I went ahead and built it on <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> with <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a> because they both make making things fun.</p>

<p>Basically I wanted a way to have some lists handy that I usually end up converting to some other format, this is that. I'm going to be rich.</p>
