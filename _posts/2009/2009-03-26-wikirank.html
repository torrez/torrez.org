<p><a href="http://www.wikirank.com/">WikiRank</a> is a fascinating front-end to <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a> that loads the freely available traffic stats and then bubbles up and charts the trends for popular pages. It's not just a clever use of the stats, it's beautifully designed. I wish Wikipedia looked more like this.</p>
