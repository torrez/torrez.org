<p>One of the things I have enjoyed about living in Northern California is what feels like access to much better, fresher beers than I was used to down south. There were plenty of places to buy beer, even craft beers in Los Angeles, but I think because I walk so much in my neighborhood and frequent liquor stores instead of Super Markets I come across many of the local stuff I would have missed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chow.com/stories/11977">This article on CHOW about Sierra Nevada Brewing</a> makes me happy for two reasons. The first is that I also, frequently (like right now) have a six pack of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in my refrigerator. </p>

<p>The second is that after about two years of going a little crazy with super hoppy beers and sour beers and beers that make you want to take a nap afterwards, I think I've started to come around to the idea of subtle beers that are good because they are well balanced, and not trying to differentiate themselves with a bit of a gimmick. </p>

<p>That said, I usually have a fresh <a href="http://www.russianriverbrewing.com/web/brews/plinytheelder.htm">Pliny The Elder</a> in my fridge as well. Shoving your nose into a big glass of Pliny is a bit of heaven I think.</p>
