<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2009/03/19/internetworld_spring_1997">Brent Simmons remembers a few conversations</a> with people at conferences and trade shows long ago. Maybe you can help track down who the people were. </p>

<p>I did the same thing with Jeffrey Zeldman at my first SXSW. I was so nervous I couldn't approach anyone. Eventually I tagged along with some folks and ended up at a party where Jeffrey was&#8212;and then I gushed like he had invented HTML, browsers, and erasable pens. Ugh. But he was really nice about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://dashes.com/anil">Anil</a>, thankfully, approached me and began introducing me around as "That File Pile Guy". The rest is history. </p>
