<p>Mike Monteiro's art <a href="http://www.20x200.com/aaa/mike-monteiro/">just went on sale at 20x200</a>. It's some wickedly unsettling stuff. I don't think it was a mistake the word "therapist" sits square in the middle of the third piece. If I stare at it long enoughâ€”well, we all see what we want to see, eh?</p>
