<p>I've been kicking around the idea of a site where you could be transported back in time to what was being released a year ago. Of all the products I buy, video games seem to have the greatest run up and fall in prices. So I figured it'd be interesting to see what that would look like if I could automatically roll back the clock when you visited.</p>

<p>The site I made is called <a href="http://www.oldbits.org/">Old Bits</a> and it's simply a way to see what was being released last year, two years ago, and three years ago. You can also navigate forwards and backwards week by week.</p>

<p>You can follow the Twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/old_bits/">@old_bits</a> where I will send a weekly update. </p>

<p>I'd love to hear <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/about.html">any and all feedback</a>. </p>
