<p>I've been fooling around with <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">Cocos2d for iPhone</a>, a 2d framework (and more) that provides an Objective-C interface to OpenGL ES 1.1. I just noticed <a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/397">a new wrapper has been released for Ruby on the iPhone</a>. </p>

<p>To make this more confusing the <a href="http://cocos2d.org/">original Cocos2d</a> is built in Python for Python that is not for use on iPhone but pretty slick in its own right.</p>
