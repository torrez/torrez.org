<p><em>I <strong>had</strong> switched to a Google G1 "Dream" phone for a month. I felt like writing about it.</em></p>

<p>I give up. I thought it'd be fun to see what life was like on a different platform but I think I've seen more than enough on this hardware. The device is definitely too slow to get anything done and I have found myself <strong>not</strong> going to the phone when in a situation where I used to check my mail and catch up on Twitter. I stood in line at the ATM and just didn't bother. </p>

<p>On Saturday my family was here to visit and I found myself reaching for the iPhone to check on a restaurant, map some directions, and to check on an order. Given a choice between the two I just could not keep flipping that thing open knowing there were other perfectly good computers nearby.</p>

<p>I took the G1 into work today but I came home knowing what I had to do. I switched the SIM back to the iPhone. I'm going to keep installing apps and carrying it with me, but the SIM stays in the iPhone. When I get my hands on <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/hero/overview.html">a Hero</a> I can <em>really</em> put Android to the test. I think the G1 was just not ready to be the hardware for Android. And I'm not ready to interact with people when presented with opportunities to tune them out. </p>

In 1999 I switched from Windows to Linux on my desktop for a year while I contracted. The fallout from that was horrendous. Lost files, corrupted Word docs, one dumb weekend where I worked in 640x480 because I hit "Okay" instead of "NO, NO, NO, GOD, NO" on an update and was clueless about how to fix it without wiping and re-installing. I switched to OS X in 2001.</li>
    <li>Ed Chang wrote in and told me about <a href="http://www.cyrket.com/package/com.cootek.touchpal">TouchPal</a> which does some really good stuff as a replacement keyboard. I used it for a bit while i searched for a podcast manager (BeyondPod seemed to be the best but did not actually work when I tried subscribing to feeds).</li>
    <li>There <strong>is</strong> <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/foursquareddev/ux/venueactivity">a Foursquare App for Android</a> that looks very promising! I will definitely be testing it out.</li>
