<p>Looking for a new iPhone game to play? You might like Shaun Inman's new game called "<a href="http://shauninman.com/horrorvacui/">Horror Vacui</a>". It's a card-based game that just does <strong>everything</strong> right. The 8-bit design is perfect, the music and sounds are fun and never get tiring, the rules are simple and the app is speedy. It's the perfect sort of pick-up-and-play-type game that works so well on the iPhone.</p>

<p>I hope this one wins an award someplace. </p>
