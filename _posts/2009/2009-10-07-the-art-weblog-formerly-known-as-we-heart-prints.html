<p>My wife used to run a fairly popular weblog called We â™¥ Prints. In between getting married, having a baby, and not sleeping, she didn't have enough time to update the site.</p>

<p>I'm happy to tell you <a href="http://www.weheartprints.com/">she's back</a>, on a new host (TypePad like me) and with a gorgeous new print by <a href="http://www.weheartprints.com/2009/10/mars1.html">MARS-1</a>.</p>

<p>So head over there, welcome her back, and buy some prints! </p>
