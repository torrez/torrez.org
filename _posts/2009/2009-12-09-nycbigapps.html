<p>I hadn't heard about this competition called <a href="http://www.nycbigapps.com/">NYC BigApps</a>. It's a project to get people to create applications using NY specific data. Submissions actually closed yesterday and voting begins in a few days. It looks great and the site <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/datamine/html/data/data.shtml">where you download data sets</a> is incredibly usable. </p>

<p>I want to play!</p>
