<p>There are three things I've always wanted to do: Learn Objective-C, make something for my iPhone, and make a game. I decided to do all three after posting about <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2009/09/shinycocos-a-ruby-wrapper-for-cocos2d.html">Cocos2d the other day</a>.</p>

<p>So here it is. </p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="303" height="400" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"> <param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=0d3aaa8f39&amp;photo_id=3932684099"></param> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"></param> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000"></param> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=0d3aaa8f39&amp;photo_id=3932684099" height="400" width="303"></embed></object></p>

<p>A card matching game. Boring, I know, but that might have been the most fun I've had with this phone in a while. The game seems to bore the pants off anyone I show it to, but I am so in love with the thing I even played it on the train for a bit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/torrez/3929474945/">My first pass</a> yielded a pretty simple demo of drawing on the screen with some game rules applied.</p>

<p>That felt too light and there were so many things I wanted to fix and change that I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/torrez/3931466581/">made a second version</a>. But <strong>that</strong> version just made me want to really finish the thing off right so I added the spinning and cleaned up the graphics and icons.</p>

<p>And tonight I was thinking, MY GOD, I could really make this thing sing and then I snapped out of it. I'm done. <a href="http://github.com/torrez/MatchGame">The source code is here</a> if you're into that sort of thing. </p>

<p>I am still new to Objective-C and I have no clue if I'm doing things incorrectly, but this is my first real project so I'd love to get any feedback on it. I think I got "synthesize" happy. I probably didn't need to do that. </p>

<p>And Cocos2d is excellent but again, I need to look at more code as the stacked layer structure with reciprocal pointers between them feels completely wrong to someone like me who makes MVC web apps. </p>
