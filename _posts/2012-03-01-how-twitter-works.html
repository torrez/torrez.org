<p>Mat’s <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5889809/did-twitter-change-the-way-replies-work">post about Twitter making a tiny change to the way @ replies work</a> reminds me of an idea I had. Someone please do it.</p>

<p>Basically every night a set of scripts run that test whether all the things we know about Twitter: how replies work, how RT’s work, how URLs are shortened, how following works, and it publishes the results into a nice one page screen people can check in with when a new version rolls out.</p>

<p>In addition the data returned in JSON responses would also tip that there are new features to check out.</p>
