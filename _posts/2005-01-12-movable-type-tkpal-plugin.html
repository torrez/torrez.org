title: Movable Type TKPal Plugin
---
<p><a href="http://www.rayners.org/">David Raynes</a> has written <a href="http://www.rayners.org/2005/01/tkpal_for_mt_10.php">a wrapper for TKPal</a> which he is, naturally, selling via <a href="http://www.simpleform.com/TKPal/">TKPal</a> on his site.</p>

<p>If you were thinking about integrating TKPal with your Movable Type blog, his wrapper is going to make it a heck of a lot easier to price each piece of content.</p>
