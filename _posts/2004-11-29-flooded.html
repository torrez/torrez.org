My friend <a href="http://www.dakotasmith.org/">Dakota</a> woke up to find his house flooded:
</p>
<blockquote>
my girlfriend woke me up in the middle of the night, "why is the dog whining?" and by the time she figured out the dog was trying to tell us she was swimming in knee high water, it was too late. i mean, it was too late even before then.
</blockquote>

Two feet of water doesn't sound like much until you see <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dakotasmith/1787052/">this picture</a> and think about all the things you have that would be destroyed by that kind of flooding.
