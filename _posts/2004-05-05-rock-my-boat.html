I'm not sure why I opened up TypePad just now, I think I felt like writing but I wasn't sure what I wanted to write about. The project I've been working on for the past five months is nearly over, we're installing in the next few days. I still have a couple of little bugs to fix, but I feel pretty confident they will be simple. I worked 92 hours last week.

Someone told me I was mentioned in the Google reviews for gmail. <a href="http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/reviews.html#blogs">The sentence they pulled out is attributed to Art Torrez</a>. Which is my uncle's name. It's cool.

I think I'm going to leave this job in the near future. This might be burn-out talking, but I feel like a toll-booth clerk. I'm not making anything anymore. It's all re-hashing what I already know. If I could figure out a way to make tools like Dropload or Nutshell full-time I'd be a happy camper.

I did do a few cool things with this site we just built. I learned a little bit of Python and built some cool XML parsing and transformation functions, I think half of that was me trying to make my work more interesting. I think our team did a pretty good job and it was fun working with them, but at the end of the day the site is pretty much a big brochure to sell video games.

I'm probably going to take my comp days and head up to SF after E3. If it wasn't for my house I would have moved up there years ago.

<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CoderToDeveloper.html">This looks like a good book to buy</a>, with a forward by Joel Spolsky. I didn't go to college very long to get any sort of formal education, most of what I do is pretty standard web dev. I flirted with Windows applications for a while, but like learning a new language, you really need to be immersed in it to get it. I can write any sort of windows app possible, I think. I don't feel limited by what my applications can do, just how I go about doing them, and maintaining them. I don't know if that made sense.

I just realized we did our whole round of bug fixes using <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/">Joel's FogBugz</a>. Funny how that works. That reminds me of something I was thinking about the other day. I'm 100 times more likely to buy something from someone who has a web prescence than someone who does not. I buy books by <a href="http://www.onfocus.com/">Paul</a>, <a href="http://www.haughey.com/">Matt</a>, <a href="http://www.usersavvy.com/">David</a>, and even <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Cory</a> quicker than I'd buy something from someone else. I can link them and read them, so I feel like I know them and I want to support them. Plus they write good books.
