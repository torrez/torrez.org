title: iPhone App Idea For Traveling With Kids
category: Idea

<p>We were on a road trip a few weeks ago and I had an idea for an educational app I would build if I had time.</p>

<p>You start the app before you take your trip and set your current location. As you drive the app updates your location on a map so it is drawing a travel line.</p>

<p>The app contains a database of distances of things and short summaries about them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Length of the longest bridge in the world</li>
<li>Width of Rhode Island</li>
<li>Length of Panama Canal</li>
<li>Distance between the Hawaiian island and Maui</li>
<li>Length of the San Francisco Bay</li>
<li>Length of dollar bills, laid end-to-end printed in the US every year</li>
<li>Diameter of the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-largest-organism-is-fungus">largest fungus in the world</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As the app notices you pass these distances the phone would receive a notification to open the app and read the info about length reached. You could continue to receive notifications on your trip back as well.</p>
