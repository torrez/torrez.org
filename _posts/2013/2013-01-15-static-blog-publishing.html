<p>Last night I did some research on static blog publishing. The winner for me was easily <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> because:</p>

<pre><code>1. it is built with Python.
2. it supports plugins.
3. it uses a sensible template engine I can tweak.
4. it allows me to write in the text editor of my choice.
</code></pre>

<p>Give or take a few bullet points this essentially is what every recently built static blog publishing engine looks like. I was ready to take the plunge when I realized: I think I am happy about these features <em>because</em> I am a programmer who likes to tweak things. As a keeper of a simple weblog (this one) what I <strong>really</strong> want is an OS X app that</p>

<pre><code>1. stores my posts in iCloud.
2. can therefore sync between computers (and phone).
3. publishes locally to a directory or to S3.
4. light generation of an index and archives.
5. markdown formatting.
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn’t even need to have an editor, though it’d be fine if it did, but I generally write in Markdown.</p>

<p>After using <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>, I realized my needs for writing are just text-area, light formatting with Markdown, and the ability to drag in images. I don’t need tags. I don’t need comments. And I definitely need a service (S3 or Dropbox) that will just be up without any tweaking or maintenance on my part.</p>

<p>What I think is cool (Pelican) is not what I really want to use every day (mystery OS X app).</p>
