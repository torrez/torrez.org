<p>For the past few months I have been using a time management method called The Pomodoro Technique. Despite the name it is a simple way to manage your work time. To follow it you:</p>

<ol>
<li>decide on the task to be done</li>
<li>set the timer to 25 minutes</li>
<li>work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x</li>
<li>take a short break (3-5 minutes)</li>
<li>every four work cycles take a longer break (15–30 minutes)</li>
</ol>

<p>The story (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">you can read it here</a>) is the inventor was studying at university and came up on the idea of partitioning time between breaks to motivate himself to work continuously for short periods. He happened to use a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato (<em>pomodoro</em> in Italian) and a pad and pencil to record his progress. </p>

<p>You don’t really need to read any more than that to get started, but there is a <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">book</a> and certification and courses and a <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/timer/">plastic tomato timer</a> because this is what people do when they can’t leave well enough alone.</p>

<p>You can try it if you want. I don’t care. The reason I am mentioning it is I finally found a good timer to use. Up until now I had been using a Pomodoro specific iPhone app that I would set next to my computer. This was fine most of the time, but sometimes I found myself away from my phone or would forget to reset it. I had tried OS X apps but they all had obtrusive windows that would get in the way.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timebar/id617829225?mt=12">Timebar</a> costs $2.99 on the App Store and is almost the perfect Pomodoro timer. Rather than barking a growl notification at you or having to manage a full window, Timebar uses a transparent color over your actual menubar to show the countdown. You use the menu bar item to interact with it and the alert window is very small.</p>

<p>The only thing I wish it had was a “ding” noise so I could know when my 5 minute breaks were up, but other than that it is just what I needed.</p>
