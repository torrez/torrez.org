<p>Having a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/dantsypants/status/289877092169035776">DantsyPants I had an idea</a> .</p>

<p>A giant storage place like you see on TV and by the freeway, but every thing I check-in is scanned and I can affix a price to it if I want. The whole catalog is put online for people to buy things and the storage place will handle shipping or you can come in and pick it up.</p>

<p>THE BEST part about this is I could clean out my closets. THE SECOND best part about this is I can buy some more things! They could even just move the thing I bought into my pile of stuff. I need to get rid of this stuff.</p>

<p>(I know there are eBay drop off companies but I haven‘t been able to figure out what happens if it doesn’t sell. And what if I don’t <em>want</em> to sell?)</p>
