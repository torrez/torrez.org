<p>Andy posted a summary of <a href="http://waxy.org/2013/06/how_xoxo_works/">how the application process of XOXO worked</a>.</p>
<p>XOXO 2012 was one of the best conferences I have ever been to. It ranks right up there with my first SXSW in 2001. Other than conferences I can’t think of too many other events I’ve been to in my life where I knew I was witnessing something so special.</p>
<p>Since we all came back from XOXO and said as much on our weblogs and Twitter, I think Andy and Andy had an almost impossible task for 2013. It still remains to be seen if they succeeded. We’ll only know once the conference is over and we’ve all returned to our weblogs and Twitter to sum up our experiences.</p>
<p>But the thing I think they did accomplish is they reminded everyone that there is value in being someone who actually makes things.</p>
