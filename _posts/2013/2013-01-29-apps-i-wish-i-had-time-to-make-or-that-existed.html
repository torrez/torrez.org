title: Apps I Wish I Had Time To Make Or That Existed

<ol>
<li>A small service that collects a set of vetted RSS feeds and looks for Twitter style @mentions. I noticed Jason <a href="http://kottke.org/13/01/game-of-tag-has-been-going-for-23-years">credited me today</a> and I didnâ€™t notice until I saw it in my RSS reader. It would have been nice to get an @mention from a bot that was watching a large amount of weblogs.</li>
<li>An iOS app that would let me create an event (like a conference) and then I can input all the addresses I will need during the event. When I was at XOXO I kept looking up the same locations when getting a cab or setting out to walk places. The distributed nature of XOXO meant that I really needed a list of about 5 places I could quickly call up and map directions to.</li>
<li>Kickstarter with a $1,000 limit and a one month delivery date.</li>
<li>A CRM that gives the support staff (or individual) a support and turn-around time rating. These stats can be used to determine if my support ticket is going to be answered quickly and if I will be happy with the response. Also if the manager of the CRM rarely answers messages on Sundays and Mondays then I would like to know that they will likely get back to me on Tuesday. I would also like to pay $5 to jump ahead in line.</li>
