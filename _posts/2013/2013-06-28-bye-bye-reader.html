<p>As you know Google Reader is going away on July 1st. Here are a few links you should know about before it does.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://readerisdead.com/">http://readerisdead.com/</a> &#8212; To pull <em>all</em> your information out of Google Reader. This includes much more than Google Takeout or just exporting your OPML.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.goread.io/">http://www.goread.io/</a> &#8212; A new day, a new reader. Here’s a clean, open-source one. I haven’t spent enough time with it to figure out the keyboard commands but it sure is pretty and fast. </li>
<li><a href="http://allyourfeed.ludios.org:8080/">http://allyourfeed.ludios.org:8080/</a> &#8212; Be sure and throw your subscriptions.xml OPML file from Google Reader in there so they can build an archive of the feeds we’re losing.</li>
</ul>
