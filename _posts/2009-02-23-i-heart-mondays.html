<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/02/21/something-for-those.html">I can't relate to this</a> post about Mondays that everyone seems excited about. I fricken <strong>LOVE</strong> Mondays. It's the start of the week. You get to see what ideas that were so important on Friday stayed important until Monday. Sometimes a couple of days brings everyone to their senses and we can leave bad ideas in the past week. </p>

<p>Mondays are a fresh start. They're like a reset button for the doldrums of your Wednesday afternoon meetings where two people are going on about something the other eight people in the room don't even understand. </p>

<p>Sundays, specifically Sunday nights, are the worst. I hate them. The last day to get stuff done and you can't even stay up late working on anything. Anything you didn't have time to do now sits around until the next weekend. </p>
