<p>I wish LinkedIn had a feature where I could pick a year, say 2008, and see where all the people I worked with at the time have moved on (or not) to. A sort of “Where are they now?” for my co-workers. What I really want is a LinkedIn for my actual work history and the people I have worked with, not people I am networking with or hope to work with. Where is the LinkedIn that restricts my contacts only to people I have or do work with?</p>
