<p>I have my fingers crossed I was in <a href="http://www.fartparty.org/2007/09/13/more-stuff/">the first 15 to pre-order the new Fart Party book</a>. Even if I wasn't, I'm extremely happy there's finally another Fart Party item I can buy. </p>

<p>When we saw her at APE all I could do was wave as I have everything she's done so far. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/thefartparty/1373721912/">The cover is here</a>.</p>
