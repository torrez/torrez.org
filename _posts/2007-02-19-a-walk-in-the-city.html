<p>After reading that <a href="http://www.shigabooks.com/">Jason Shiga</a> might possibly have some of his books at the <a href="http://www.super7store.com/">Super 7</a> store in San Francisco I decided I wanted to try and get one. </p>

<p>Turns out his very cool and rare books aren't just laying about at any old store. I did get to see more of the city so the walk was worth it, plus I did pick up some good comics.</p>

<p>Check out the whole set here:<br /><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/sets/72157594544767172/">http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/sets/72157594544767172/</a> </p>
