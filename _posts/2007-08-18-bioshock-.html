<p>I played the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock">BioShock</a> demo this morning. I absolutely loved it. Set in an art-deco-styled, underwater world, the game manages to add interesting twists on top of a pretty solid FPS game. The scripted moments where you have to escape danger (or dive right into it) are perfectly done. Nothing feels faked or set up. </p>

<p>The Metacritic reviews are <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/bioshock">outstanding</a>. </p>
