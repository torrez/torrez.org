<p><a href="http://seantevis.com/kansas/3000/running-for-office-xkcd-style/">Excellently done campaign announcement</a>. You might have already seen this, but Sean is an Internet-style friend, so I feel it's my duty to help him get the word out to his fellow Kansans. I think he has some pretty good ideas.</p>

<p>I must admit, I feel a little sneaky giving someone in another state money to run as a representative for people I do not know. But then again, this is Kansas…you know, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/08/AR2005110801211.html">Kansas</a>…and that's still a state in my country's union so I was compelled.</p>
