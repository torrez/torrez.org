The nice thing about Google is that if you have a tech support problem, you can copy and paste the error and find 10 other people who had the problem. Perfect example is the worst debug message in recent memory, AOL's: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22feedbag+error%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">feedbag error</a>.

It's a Friday afternoon before a three day weekend so my employer is paying me to mod my desktop with some <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/">Unsanity</a> and <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a> software while I do my weekly server upgrades.
</p>
<p>
I just rebooted after some fairly big tweaks, including upgrading to 10.3.4, and I get the error I pasted in my title bar. Related to the Unsanity/Panic stuff? Doubtful. This is the Mail.app, which hasn't been touched. The 10.3.4 upgrade is probably more likely. I just can't seem to find anyone with answers in Google.

Which is why I'm posting. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22+If+you+open+a+mailbox+that+already+is+in+use,+you+may+damage+its+contents.%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Maybe someone can figure it out</a>. Maybe I'll figure it out and update here. Maybe I shouldn't rely on Google for tech support. Ah well..My dock is <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/cleardock">SEE-THRU</a>!
