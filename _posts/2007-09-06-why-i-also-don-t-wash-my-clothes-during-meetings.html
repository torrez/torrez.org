<p><a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/08/31/the_laptop_herring.html">Taking laptops to meetings</a>. I rarely take my laptop to meetings. If I do it's because of the possibility of following along with something online, or being the presenter. I used to take it when there was a crisis and I was waiting on an email from someone, but now I have an iPhone for that so people can call if it's that important.</p>

<p>During some meetings I'm the least needed person there, but I like to sit and listen to people because most of the time I'm learning a lot about worlds outside of my own. Things I've never dealt with but know are pretty important and worth hearing. If I had a laptop I wouldn't get all that free insight from some smart people.</p>

<p>I like how Michael ends this piece, it's really good advice for any standing meeting.</p>
