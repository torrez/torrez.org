After sitting on the sidelines for a few years with my POS Danger HipTop while everyone else was using Flickr and Bluetooth and keeping in sync with their address book, I finally gave up on Danger and bought the <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=602">Sony Ericsson s710a</a>.
</p>

<a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/features/2005/02/the_sony_ericcs.html">Matt's review</a> of the s700i and <a href="http://www.michaelbuffington.com/">Michael</a>'s thumbs up helped me make my decision.

It's taking some time getting used to not having a device built for text based conversations, but I think this is a good thing. I'm trying to stop composing and chatting on my mobile device because I realize being outside and away from the Internet is probably when I shouldn't be on the Internet.
