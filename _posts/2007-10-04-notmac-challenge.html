<p>I totally missed this, but it looks like there was a <a href="http://www.notmacchallenge.com/">contest to produce a free and open sourced version</a> of the wildly under-featured for its price .Mac. For now both the server and client have to be running OS X, but people are already working on making the server Linux/Windows compatible.</p>

<p>Dude won $8,622! </p>
