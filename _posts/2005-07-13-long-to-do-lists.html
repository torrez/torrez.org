Today has been a long todo list day. Some stuff piled up this week and I had to burn through them most of the morning. I'm creating most of my todos, so it's really my own fault, but one thing I've already realized is I have to do things in moderation. It's very easy to bite off more than you can chew when you're eating alone most of the time.

I'll be up in SF soon and in an office. Something about having a place to go means having boundaries on your day.

I do enjoy having a nice walk to lunch, though.
