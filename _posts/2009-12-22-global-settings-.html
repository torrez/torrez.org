<p><a href="http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/12/blogging-tools.html">Joshua's post about unbundling the tools</a> for deploying publishing components reminded me of a service I wish someone would make. </p>

<p>I want someone to build a user preferences service that would free up developers from having to re-implement settings and preferences in their applications. Something like Cocoa's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/Mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSUserDefaults_Class/Reference/Reference.html">NSUserDefaults</a> that provides an interface for retrieving and storing user preferences in a user's local library.</p>

<p><strong>update:</strong> Someone pointed out I wasn't completely clear with this. The idea is the service runs in the cloud and provides an interface for any application to query and store key/value pairs per user.</p>

<p>I previously <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2005/01/typekey_playsta.html">wrote about this idea</a> (five years ago!) and I still want it. </p>
