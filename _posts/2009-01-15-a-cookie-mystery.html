<p>I've enjoyed watching my friend at work unravel a cookie recipe mystery over the past couple of weeks. He just <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2009/01/melt-in-the-mouth-cookies-a-brief-history/">posted the full story to his weblog</a>.</p>

<p>He also brought in a batch which are VERY GOOD COOKIES. You should totally make some.</p>
