<p>Wow, lots of links to get through today. Be sure and check out the Youtube video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfmJ6m97HqQ">"zZz is playing: Grip"</a> for a pretty cool, uncut video with no special effects. If you're an iPhone fan there's <a href="http://www.applehound.com/node/104">some bugs</a> you can re-create if you like that sort of thing (I like that sort of thing).</p>

<ul>
