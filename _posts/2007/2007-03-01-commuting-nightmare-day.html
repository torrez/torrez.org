Another commuting nightmare today. I missed bus #1, then missed bus #2 due to an absent J Muni train (not sure what train NextBus was tracking as it never arrived), I remembered a ferry departure was in twenty minutes so I ran to catch the first inbound from Civic Center only to get stuck in the tunnel before my exit. After sitting for several minutes within view of my stop I walked to the ferry building only to be told I was too late.

It's amazing how difficult it can be to get from my home to work only 11 miles away.

There's a discussion going on at work about our office location. The developers all live in SF and Oakland and would kill for not only a simpler commute (oh under an hour would be swell) but some peace and quiet would be even more welcome. New offices have the promise of separate work areas (a.k.a. offices/cubes). Non-developers rarely understand the need for an absence of external noises, so we all must a appear a little odd sitting in our big room with iTunes cranked to cover up all the impromptu meetings. But it's absolutely essential our <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/07/30.html">flow</a> is uninterrupted. And right now, that's not happening.

One of my goals this year is to say yes to each and every one of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel's Test</a>. Although by his estimates we've "got serious problems", we're knocking on <strong>tolerable</strong>'s door. And I will be able to reach that goal if we could say "yes" to item #8 with a better working environment and location.
