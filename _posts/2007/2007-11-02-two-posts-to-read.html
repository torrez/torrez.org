<p>I'll post my delicious links later today, but I have a meeting in a few minutes so I thought I'd link two things that I read this morning that I think are worth reading.</p>

<p>The first is <a href="http://evhead.com/2007/11/where-should-you-be.asp">Ev's first post</a> answering reader submitted questions. Great stuff. Especially the bit about the companies he admires, they're mine too. (Add <a href="http://www.coudal.com/">Coudal</a>'s <a href="http://northmay.com/">Northmay</a> to that list for me).</p>

<p>The second is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/11/02/whatIsItLikeToWorkAtGoogle.html">Dave Winer poking at Google</a> with an observation of Apple in the late 80s. It was sent to me by a co-worker who <em>did</em> work at Apple in the late 80s.</p>
