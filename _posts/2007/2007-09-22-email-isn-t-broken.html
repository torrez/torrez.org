<p>I think <a href="http://twitter.com/factoryjoe/statuses/282610332">Chris sums it up nicely</a>. Email <em>applications</em> <a href="http://jimmyg.org/2007/09/22/ideal-email-client/">need to be more open and configurable</a>. I don't believe email is broken, as some people like to say, I think it's just how we interact with it that needs fixing. </p>

<p>At work I've taken up portions of Merlin's <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero/">Inbox Zero</a> and it's changed my work day entirely. I reply to anything that needs replying and I am on top of many conversations. On Friday I left the office with a completely empty inbox. Heck, my <em>Mom</em> even noticed I reply to her promptly.</p>
