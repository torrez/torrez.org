<p>About a month ago <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2007/09/trafficking.html">I posted some theories on getting more traffic to your weblog</a>. I give out this advice so much to people that I figured I should prove it by moving my (totally unverifiable, and random) Alexa ranking below 800,000. I didn't have any traffic goals, as I assumed they would increase by some percentage I couldn't predict.</p>

<p>First, I started opening my stats every day. Before this month I rarely looked at my stats. I write my weblog for myself first, and for friends second. My audience is intentionally small (plus I can look foolish in front of friends, I don't care). So the idea of watching stats was completely foreign, it's for the big blogs that have ads and depend on the traffic to live.</p>

<p>I attempted to exploit the positive feedback loop of staring at stats to make the stats go up and I think it worked. I would notice traffic falling off on the weekend and make a point to bookmark some items I might like to link to throughout the week. </p>

<p>Second, I had to set aside time in my day to really hit my feed reader. A quote from Google Reader's trends: "From your  193 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 10,432 items, starred 3 items, shared 0 items, and emailed 0 items." It's a lot of work staying on top of your feeds, and I had to force myself some afternoons to quickly flip through the big sites to see what people were talking about. It's hard work to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>My new Alexa stat ranking: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=notes.torrez.org">619,546</a>. Looking at the 1 week averages (since the 3 mo. averages include the months I was not driving the rating down) my Alexa ranking is 464,345. If I kept up my pace over the next year I think I could easily land somewhere in the 400's for good, high 300's would be swell.</p>

<p>The missing element here is quality. Quality is pretty much the only thing that will keep you in the big leagues once you get there. I can't speak to having a good voice or consistent delivery of quality content so I left it off my original list of things to do.</p>

<p>As some people have a face for radio, I tend to think I have a writing voice that makes a case to start a site with user generated content. </p>
