I just received this notification that my &quot;Old Skool&quot; Flickr account is going to be migrated to Yahoo either by choice (I can change it by March 15th) or they'll just do it for me.
</p>
<p>
Fine, whatever, I think it's lame as I liked having my old sign in not tied to Yahoo but borgs will be borgs. The interesting part is they say:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
&quot;...95% of your fellow Flickrites already use this system and
their experience is just the same as yours is now, except
they sign in on a different page....&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If 5% of my audience, die hards from the early days (the ones who told friends who told friends), had decided on doing something a particular way and did not change for several years after being give a choice to—I just don't think I'd have the guts to email them telling them they were no longer allowed to make that choice.
</p>
<p>
Maybe 5% is an acceptable number, I really don't know how many users there are but 5% seems enormous to me.
</p>
<p>
I've never managed a user base the size of Flickr, but I'd have trouble clicking &quot;send&quot; to 5% of my &quot;Old Skool&quot; peeps if I was them.</p>

<p>I dont' think anyone will care about this on March 16th, but it's that initial communication and the following weeks where people will gripe and be annoyed at having to join or else, it really does feel like a bummer. </p>

<p>Also, Monday morning quarter-backing: They should have rolled out these
new awesome features and said, “Sorry, your account can’t access them
because it uses Yahoo API’s tied into login. Wanna switch?” Of course, knowing nothing about the infrastructure or time constraints ($) this probably wasn't an option, still, I wouldn't have felt so bummed about it.</p>
