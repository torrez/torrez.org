<p>While discussing our pending Germany trip:</p>

<p><strong>Amber:</strong> Guten abend!<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> It's not "guten nacht"?<br />
<strong>Amber:</strong> Close, "nacht" is only for when you're really going to bed. And it's "gute".<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Ahh "gute nacht".<br />
<strong>Amber:</strong> Yup. (Surprised) How did you know the word for "night"? Are you listening to tapes too?<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> No, uh, "Kristallnacht" was this horrific event in Jewish German history where there was a concerted effort by Goebbels to terrorize and imprison thousands of Jews. It translates to "Crystal Night" in reference to the windows being smashed of shops and the mayhem in general.<br />
<strong>Amber:</strong> Oh...<br />
<br />
<strong>Me:</strong> Sorry. All the German I know comes from the History Channel and beer labels.<br /></p>
