<p>I finally got my second monitor at work. It's a small 19" widescreen SyncMaster that does the simple job of providing more space to put windows on. I find it incredible that people think it's a luxury when it's really a necessity. </p>

<p>I can't believe I've gone this long without the second monitor and the only thing that prompted it was being told by someone that nobody needs that much space. If I had more money I'd get a third one the same size flanking my Apple monitor.</p>
