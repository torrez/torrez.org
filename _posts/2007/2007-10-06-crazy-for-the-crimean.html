<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/10/14237.html">Jason</a> linked to two parts of a three part series by <a href="http://www.errolmorris.com/">Errol Morris</a> about an iconic photograph taken during the Crimean War. (<a href="http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg-part-one/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://morris.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/which-came-first-part-two/">Part 2</a>). I read both posts on my ride to work and by the time I got into the office all I could think about was The Crimean war. Ooh, gotta get a book on the Crimean War! Reading all about the Crimean on Wikipedia. I'm crazy for the Crimean!</p>

<p>After visiting both Borders Books in Downtown SF I bought the <em>last</em> book between them on the subject. The <em>last</em> book between them turns out to be a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Crimean-War-Unnecessary/dp/0786718307/nutshell-20">condensed version</a> which seems to be a good introduction based on the reader review. I'm hoping everyone read the Errol Morris posts and bought up all but one of the books on the subject&#8212;but I doubt it.</p>
