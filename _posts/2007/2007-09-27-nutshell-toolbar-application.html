<p>Weird. An toolbar app I wrote (<a href="http://www.kottke.org/02/02/nutshell-from-mr-torrez-is">at the suggestion of Jason</a>) <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/09/27/how-to-get-much-more-out-of-ms-internet-explorer/">just showed up on Web Worker Daily</a>. I haven't owned a Windows computer almost as long as that's been out, which was 2002. </p>

<p>I probably could have milked that app a bit, but I've always shied away from charging for stuff which should just be free. When Firefox debuted with built-in search, I switched to it and forgot about <a href="http://www.torrez.org/projects/nutshell/">Nutshell</a>.</p>

<p>I have the problem where if something seems obvious and simple, I think it should just be free for the taking. Add to that the fact I refer to it as "a problem" and I'm sure there's a whole mess of missed opportunities in my past projects.</p>
