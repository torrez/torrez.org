<p>Can I just say the second most exciting thing happening a week from now is me wearing my fancy new suit? If I could wear it every day to work I would. The list looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Marrying Amber Costley.</li>
<li>Wearing mah suit. </li>
<li>Fiji.</li>
<li>Packing for a trip and not taking a coat. None!</li>
</ol>
