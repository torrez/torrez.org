title: There's A Conversation Going On
---
<p>A long time ago I wrote a short bit about a local Los Angeles Metro TV personality /commercial star named <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2004/11/go_see_cal.html">Cal Worthington</a>. Every month or so I get a few visitors (Google, I assume) who read through and add their own LA area memory. Check out the comments, they span almost three years!</p>

<p><a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2004/11/go_see_cal.html">The thread itself</a> has gotten quite long, much longer than my little germ of a post, and it makes me happy to see something continue to grow like that as each person adds their own memory. It's like one of those registry books that sit in some bar in a corner of the world.</p>
