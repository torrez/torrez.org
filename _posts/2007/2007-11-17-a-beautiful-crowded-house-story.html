<p><a href="http://jordanbrock.com/2007/11/18/16-years-2-weeks-and-1-day">A Beautiful Crowded House Story</a>. I don't care what anyone thinks, I'm requesting our DJ play "Something So Strong" at the wedding.</p>

<p>Incidentally, when I <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=eV-HjM80ii8">saw that video</a> I told my dad (who is a barber) to cut my hair EXACTLY like Neil Finn. My father, being a complete professional who takes hair cutting very seriously, wouldn't do it. "It looks like they cut each other's hair!" He'd refuse.</p>

<p>They probably did.</p>
