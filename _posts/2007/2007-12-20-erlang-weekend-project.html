<p>It's only Thursday and I already have my <a href="http://weblog.plexobject.com/?p=1592">weekend project</a> laid out for me. I've been toying with Erlang for a while, dropping it for a month or so only to pick it up again. I haven't written anything of any size, but now that the wedding is over I'm going to dive back and and build a little test app, possibly deployed on EC2.</p>

<p>Here's an interesting post about <a href="http://yarivsblog.com/articles/2007/12/14/amazon-simpledb-runs-on-erlang/">Amazon's SimpleDB internals</a>. Yep: it's Erlang.</p>
