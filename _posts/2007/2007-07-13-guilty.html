<p><a href="http://www.bluishorange.com/?x=2007_07_01_archive.html#7937343896940110304">Dear Alison from 2007</a>,</p>

<p>You're right. I'm guilty. I will do better. This is the 1,000th post to <em>notes</em> since I moved over to TypePad and I really let this thing lapse into a linkfeed. While I love the ease of del.icio.us popping links I bookmark over there, it's no replacement for the weblog I want this to be, so I'm going to shut that off for a bit and see how it goes.</p>

<p>If anyone is at all interested in subscribing to my del.icio.us links, <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/torrez">you can do so here</a>. </p>

<p>Update: I made this <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/rILeJSe_2xGQ3OqfJZhxuA/run?_render=rss">Yahoo! pipe of everything</a>.</p>
