<p>OH this was not cool. Our upstairs neighbor had a water leak and so our bedroom was rained on. The only real damage that came out of this was the wood on our bed blistered up.<br /><br />When I walked into the room you couldn't see where the water had come from so it was pretty crazy for a minute. I almost thought someone had been in the apartment and...I dunno, sprayed water everywhere. I knew it was water because my first instinct was to smell it. :)
<br /><br />
The ceiling had no spots and the water seemed to be in random places. It wasn't until this morning that you could see the water stains and where the water traveled once it seeped through the ceiling. Our neighbors upstairs came down and cleaned the whole thing up, so that was cool of them.<br clear="all" /></p>
