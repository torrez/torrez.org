<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/starbucks/">The Apple/Starbucks feature</a> felt like a "meh" during the announcements yesterday, but this morning I found myself in a Starbucks and "I Melt With You" started playing, but slower and sung by a woman. </p>

<p>Even though I don't buy sappy remakes of songs from my teen years, my curiosity was getting the best of me. Before I was just a dope standing in line tapping away on my iPhone, now I can be a dope buying things! Getting people to buy music when they're not in a music store has always been the plan, whether you're sitting at your desk or grabbing coffee and the newspaper on a Sunday afternoon.</p>
