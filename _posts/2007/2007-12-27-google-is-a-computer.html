<p>Google Reader's new friendz feature is the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life! I think it's worth pointing out that when we don't like software, people can <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/" title="more than a fix, it works great">turn around a fix quickly</a>. I think <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/12/26/google_security.html">Paul's take was best</a>: had Google made it work correctly from the start or soon after launch, people wouldn't have adapted to the broken-ness of the software. </p>

<p>I just like noting things like this to file away in my own development experience. Of course I'm joking about it ruining my life, but I did hide all my friendz; if I want to know what they're sharing I'll read their weblog.</p>
