<p>I'm just hanging out in the hotel room listening to my parents:</p>

<p>Mom: Oh, I just realized <em>the reindeer</em> is named Blitzen.<br />
Dad: Wait, then what is his name?<br />
Mom: Blitzer.<br />
Dad: Huh.<br /></p>

<p>I talked to Amber a bit, just lots of happy words and excitement. I realize now I should have practiced combing my hair a little nicer than normal. I have been cursed with awful hair all my life: first cowlicks, then going gray, and finally just falling out like some troubled teens fleeing a busted up house party. </p>

<p>While my dad cut my hair we calculated he's cut it 300 times. That's 75 hair cuts for every joke he knows.</p>

<p>I'm going to get dressed now. Still not nervous, just excited and very happy.</p>
