<p>Don't get me wrong, I love my iPhone. I take it everywhere. I use the alarm to wake up in the morning and while the shower warms up I scan my work email. I hit <a href="http://reader.google.com/">the</a> news reader on the bus and devour podcasts like nobody's business. I cannot imagine using another phone/mobile computer any time soon.</p>

<p>That said, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/krautwald/1485102464/">my god look at this beautiful, simple phone</a>. It's the Motorola F3 (MOTOFONE) and it's not your typical mobile phone. Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Motofone_F3">Wikipedia entry</a> to find out about the "electronic paper" display, the fact that its original target is developing markets, and that it runs a Linux variant.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Motofone_F3#Limitations">The limitations are plentiful</a>, but I can think of tons of people who would absolutely love this phone. If this was Apple's first entry into the phone market I wouldn't have been surprised.</p>
