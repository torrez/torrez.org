<p>This turned into an unexpected late night. Shift refresh, you should see a new site (or an old site if you read <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/">(un)filtered</a>).</p>

<p>I'm not a designer, but I know what I like. When I saw Michael's new site I knew it was what I wanted for myself. I got the "okay" from him and redid his site by hand with CSS and only one table (shakes fist at HTML forms). I couldn't bring myself to copy and paste it, plus I have been wanting to learn how to do my own custom template through <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> so it became a project.</p>

<p>It's late, I haven't had a chance to debug, and I have almost 1,000 entries to re-classify after realizing I really didn't need most of them (<a href="http://notes.torrez.org/genitals/index.html">genitals?</a>).</p>
