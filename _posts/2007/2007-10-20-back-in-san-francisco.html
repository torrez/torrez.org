<p>We're back in San Francisco after visiting Amsterdam and Brussels for two weeks. I have 500+ photos to sift through and upload, hundreds of sites to catch up on, and I haven't checked but I'm assuming several thousand work-related pieces of email. Federated Media loves its email.</p>

<p>But aside from all that data to digest I'm happy to be home and happy to be in San Francisco. It only took one 12 hour flight + a full night's rest to reset my clock. </p>

<p>I don't know where to begin on how supremely satisfying the last two weeks have been. Instead I'll mention the four books I had with me on my trip. I think they more than adequately describe where my head is right now: the very excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Crimean-War-Unnecessary/dp/0786718307/nutshell-20" title="Thanks Errol Morris">A Brief History of the Crimean War</a>, the very good (but not as good as Pattern Recognition) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spook-Country-William-Gibson/dp/0399154302/nutshell-20">Spook Country</a> by William Gibson, and perhaps the best travel map-books I've ever used (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knopf-CityMap-Guide-Amsterdam-Citymap/dp/0375709835/nutshell-20">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knopf-MapGuide-Brussels-Mapguides/dp/0375710892/nutshell-20">Brussels</a>). </p>

<p>I included the Knopf map-books because they were not just incredibly useful, but their graphic and information design was consistently good; so good I'd almost classify them as inspiring examples of how to translate a staggering amount of information into simple tools you can carry with you. That kind of attention to detail should always be noted and praised.</p>

<p>This is all a round-about way of saying the books I read inspired me to try writing again. Which, to me, is pretty wondrous news. More later.</p>
