<p>I came back from my vacation to find most of my favorite sites doing their "year's best" lists. Rex's <a href="http://www.fimoculous.com/archive/post-3535.cfm">Best Blogs of 2007 That You (Maybe) Aren't Reading</a> is a good one. I found three excellent blogs today!</p>

<p>Anything you'd add?</p>
