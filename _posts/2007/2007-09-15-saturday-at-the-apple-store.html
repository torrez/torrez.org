<p>I took my Apple Rebate in to get an iPod shuffle so Amber and I could, uh, shuffle songs back and forth between us on our commutes. Kind of like a mix-tape that keeps on giving. Now we'll be able to sort out wedding music by making each other playlists on an entirely dispensable device. Plus I get to make Amber mix tapes, and that's always fun.</p>
