<p>I think all timers&mdash;kitchen timers as well as <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/flextime/">software timers</a> in software&mdash;should be able to do math. I find I am routinely going over to the oven to enter the time left on the clothes washer which gives me the time in wash and rinse amounts, so I find myself adding time in my head and then entering into the panel. </p>
