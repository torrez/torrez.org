<p>What a funny story: apparently Coco Chanel designed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel_No.5" title="Chanel No. 5 on Wikipedia">Chanel No. 5</a> bottle to <a href="http://www.notcot.com/archives/2007/09/chanel_proporti.php">perfectly match a square in Paris called Place Vend&ocirc;me</a>.</p>

<p>Even with the photos, I still have trouble believing this is true. </p>
