<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/"><img src="http://notes.torrez.org//images/Picture 26.png" border="0" height="45" width="34" alt="Picture 26.png" align="right" style="margin:10px;" /></a>This past week a few of my friends who weren't at SXSW griped about the change in how people were using <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Suddenly it became less about random thoughts and actions related to our individual lives, and more of a way to coordinate meetups and dinners amongst those fortunate enough to be in Austin.</p>

<p>I didn't mind it quite as much as everyone else, in fact, I kind of like seeing systems appropriated for something different. I like seeing how the developers react (I suspect friend buckets and filters are coming soon to Twitter and/or Twitterific) and I like thinking about how I would fix the problem. </p>
