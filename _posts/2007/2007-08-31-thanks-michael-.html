<p>This might be the first time I've actually had a beer in honor of someone's life, but tonight I'll drink that La Chouffe I bought last week in memory of <a href="http://www.beerhunter.com/">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="http://www.beertown.org/michaeljackson/">who died yesterday</a>.</p>

<p>I recently got back into brewing, and while reading forums and catching up on styles and methods, I was reminded that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson_%28writer%29">Michael's influence is profound</a>. I'd wager every micro-brew in America was started by someone who was inspired by his work.</p>
