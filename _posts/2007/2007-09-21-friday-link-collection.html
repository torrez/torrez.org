<p>It's Friday, I should get in the habit of cleaning out the backlog of links every week.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.bustedtees.com/shirt/airguitarhero/male/?utm_medium=EMail&amp;utm_source=092107&amp;utm_campaign=AirGuitarHero">Busted Tees - Air Guitar Hero.</a> A t-shirt with the guitar hero controller on it. Printed shirts are like bumper stickers sometimes, I appreciate them but when they're on other people.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.woot.com/Blog/BlogEntry.aspx?BlogEntryId=2929">Woot : Microsoft Zune 30GB Digital Media Player</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/2007/09/19/excuse-me-i-believe-you-have-my-stapler/">excuse me, I believe you have my stapler.</a> Eyes on the prize! Nannies like this make work life lame.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RW01knrGV8">YouTube - Devo performing Satisfaction (live on SNL '78)</a> - Never saw this before. If it was 1978 and I saw this I'd be freaked the hell out.</li>
    <li><a href="http://monstro.com/2007/09/open-letter-to-bob-buckter-color.php">monstro!: An open letter to Bob Buckter, color consultant, San Francisco.</a> - Two houses on my street have done this as well. They get covered up like a birthday present only to find out later it's just socks. Brown socks.</li>
    <li><a href="http://rc3.org/2007/09/sophia-from-kid.php">Sophia from Kid Nation assesses President Bush - rc3.org</a> - William Henry Harrison, you fool!</li>
