<p><a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/clip/skate-video-tickles-the-funnybone-297326.php">Skate video of skaters bailing</a>, the twist is it's from the upcoming video game by EA called <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/skate/index.html">skate.</a> There are lots of real videos you can buy full of this sort of thing, and most skate videos have some section devoted to it now, so why shouldn't a video game?</p>
