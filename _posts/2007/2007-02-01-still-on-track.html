<p>I'm still keeping my new year's resolution of learning Spanish. Every week I download <a href="http://www.coffeebreakspanish.com">my podcast</a> and listen to it several times on the train or walking to the office. I find that repeating them throughout the week helps set the info in my head so when the next podcast arrives the past lesson is still fresh.</p>

<p>As I walk I also read numbers and think about questions I could ask about the city if I was a tourist. </p>

<p>I am the most boring person I know!</p>

<p>Anyway, the podcast is no longer sufficient and I've subscribed to the premium podcast. Sure, it costs a bit more, but </p>
