<p>In case you hadn't heard, <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> was recently acquired by <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/">Red Sweater Software</a> and they have been starting to issue minor updates and fixes. The recent release features bug fixes and (woo) Blogger support, but I'm mostly looking forward to the addition of drag-and-drop images with uploading (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>I tried ecto a few times, and found it clunky and a little complex for what I needed to doâ€”just write a blog post. If you hadn't tried MarsEdit before it's probably worth checking out.</p>
