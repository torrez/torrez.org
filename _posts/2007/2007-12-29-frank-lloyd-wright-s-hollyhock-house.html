<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hustlerofculture/sets/72057594053184751/">A Flickr photo-set of Wright's Hollyhock House</a>. found on <a href="http://www.hewnandhammered.com/hewn_and_hammered/">H+H</a>.</p>

<p>The town I grew up in has <a href="http://www.dignitymemorial.com/7021/LocalHome.aspx?id=home&amp;LocNumbNLang=7021&amp;LoadDefault=0" title="no actual pictures here, just an address">a mortuary</a> designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. It's very beautiful inside and inconspicuous from the outside. I have to remember to take photos of it someday&#8212;though every time I'm there it's not a very good time for snapping photos.</p>
