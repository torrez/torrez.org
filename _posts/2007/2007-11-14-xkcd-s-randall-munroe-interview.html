<p>A <a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/11/xkcd">Randall Munroe</a> interview. My favorite type of comedy is the kind that manages to make a joke about something you thought only existed in your own head. It's so rare when someone can <a href="http://xkcd.com/252/">consistently</a> do <a href="http://xkcd.com/276/">that</a>.</p>
