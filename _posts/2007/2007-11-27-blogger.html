<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/2070927186/">I took this photo the other day</a> while shopping on 24th St. in Noe. When I was younger I'd be too shy to ask for photos or approach people like that, but I gave him some money and asked him if it was cool and he said "sure!" and I snapped it.</p>

<p>A Blogger logo in the wild is notable to me because something like 8 years ago I saw someone wearing a Blogger shirt in Marina del Rey and didn't approach them. I always regretted that because anyone in '99 or '00 who had heard of Blogger back then was probably a pretty cool person to know. I was far too shy and simply went back to my office and IM'd <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/">Matt Haughey</a> who was still working at Blogger to let him know I saw someone wearing a Blogger shirt. (Well it was a big deal to <em>me</em>, I dunno if Matt remembers, maybe he was at KnowNow?)</p>

<p>The Blogger shirt is a little symbolic of that part of me that doesn't want to bother people, doesn't want to introduce himself, or bug anyone. So when I saw that guy I immediately walked over and introduced myself. </p>

<p>And Blogger the application is symbolic of the "oversharing Andre" it let me be that was in such contrast to the "undersharing Andre" that I was in real life. </p>
