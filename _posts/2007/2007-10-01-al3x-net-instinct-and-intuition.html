<p><a href="http://www.al3x.net/2007/09/instinct-and-intuition.html">A good observation by Alex</a> on the multitude of processes and systems that seem to bubble up every couple of months, and how one should approach them. I love to keep track of processes and distill the common sense out of them, but never follow them to the letter simply because I know myself better than someone inventing a scheme for me. </p>
