<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haySeFqBu44">A wedding invitation</a> sent out on DVDs. thanks <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/">justin</a>.</p>

<p>We actually did pretty good on the RSVPs, only three actual declines, and we ended up on the exact number we had originally estimated. It's a weird thing, watching the responses come back and getting excited when you see people accepting. For a few days there it seemed like nobody was going to respond and you get that little panic like, "OMG maybe we can just charge some people off Craigs List for a nice dinner, dancing, and cake!"</p>
