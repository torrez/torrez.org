The clever sales people here at FM do some really cool things.  I'll let Adrants explain it: <a href="http://www.adrants.com/2007/05/ask-ask-a-ninja-get-together-for-algo.php">Adrants &raquo; Ask, Ask a Ninja Get Together for Algo</a>.

Also, <a href="http://www.castfire.com/">Castfire</a> is pretty cool tech. Of all the video delivery systems we looked at, Castfire was perfect for the job, and Brian went out of his way to make sure the project went smoothly. If you're looking for a full featured video player for your podcast, check out Castfire.
