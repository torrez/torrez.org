<p>My little experiment in tossing links out of the main blog didn't work out so hot. I like linking things, but I don't like the lazy feeling of stuff just showing up here at some point in the day.</p>

<p>If I could just edit and format my links for the day in a nice way I'd be much happier with them appearing inline. </p>

<p>So that's what I'm going to do. I built myself a little script in JavaScript that uses the JSON feed to generate a page where I can select which links I want to publish and then have them populate a simple unordered list which I can copy and paste into a new post:</p>

<p><a href="http://torrez.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/16/picture_4_2.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=357,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Picture_4_2" title="Picture_4_2" src="http://notes.torrez.org/images/2007/07/16/picture_4_2.png" width="200" height="111" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>Produces this (which I was able to edit a bit):</p>

Though I'm not a fan of the hippie feel-goods painting "You Are Loved" all over the sidewalks here, but this is pretty good.</li>

<p>You can <a href="http://torrez.org/projects/delicious/delicious.html">download the source here</a>. Feel free to mess with it, it's a little messy and I haven't tested it on anything but Firefox. If you want to add to it and do cooler stuff with it, feel free. Public domain and stuff.</p>

<p>Trust me, the last thing you want is a blog all about how <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2007/07/timers.html">they should add calculators to kitchen timers</a> (wtf?).</p>
