<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/05.html">Joel posts about that little sentence on every iPod</a>. Poor little Microsoft can't catch a break.</p>

<p>This reminds me of something that bugs me to no end. The use of "Hollywood" to describe the movie industry. Everyone from Albuquerque to Albania thinks "Hollywood" is where they make movies. Where the ideas come from. Where the porn and violence are manufactured. The truth is "Hollywood" is so spread out and difficult to define that you'd be more accurate bitching about Culver City or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley#Economy">The San Fernando Valley</a> (porn).</p>

<p>The truth is, you'd be more likely to see some yahoo tourist from Albuquerque or Albania than an actual movie star on Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
