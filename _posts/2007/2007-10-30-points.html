<p>Ben Brown <a href="http://benbrown.com/says/2007/10/29/i-love-my-chicken-wire-mommy/">reveals a bit on how their point system worked</a> (and didn't) on <a href="http://www.consumating.com/">Consumating</a>. </p>

<p>Points as currency always seemed too challenging to implement without a the checks and balances it'd require so I never did it on FP. Now I think it's too late. To focus on the points would change the way people interact with each other and the site.</p>

<p>I can't wait to see what else Ben writes in subsequent <a href="http://benbrown.com/says/category/chickenwiremommy/">I Love My Chicken Wire Mommy Posts</a>. It's a pretty interesting subject to me. </p>
