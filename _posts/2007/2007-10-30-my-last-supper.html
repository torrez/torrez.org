<p>Also from <a href="http://www.neatorama.com">Neatorama</a>: <a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1673230_1465236,00.html">an excerpt</a> from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Last-Supper-Portraits-Interviews/dp/1596912871/nutshell-20">My Last Supper</a> on Time's site where 50 chefs were asked about their last supper.</p>

<p>Mine would be a recipe my mom concocted for chicken. It's an adobo-like marinade that is a celebration of vinegar and spices. Filipinos love their vinegar. Yum.</p>
