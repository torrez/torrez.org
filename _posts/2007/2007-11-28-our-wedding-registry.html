<p>The <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2007/11/buy-handmade.html">last post</a> reminded me: Did I mention Amber and I are getting married in a few weeks? People have been asking about our registry and I'm happy to say "we ain't got one." We already have too much crap, and asking for more crap when you already have crap is a bit selfish. So we decided to just ask people donate to <a href="http://www.cityofhope.org/" title="click donate">City of Hope</a>. </p>

<p>If you've ever felt like there weren't any trustworthy charities (are you really buying a cow, a future cow, or the idea of a cow?), <a href="http://www.cityofhope.org/HowtoHelp/stewardship.htm">you can trust City of Hope</a>. Here's more on <a href="http://www.cityofhope.org/HowtoHelp/whyhelp.htm">what they have done</a>. There's even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Hope_National_Medical_Center">more on Wikipedia</a> outlining their contributions to the medical community and the different ways in which they provide medical care and support.</p>
