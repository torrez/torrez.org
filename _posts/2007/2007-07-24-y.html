<p>Today it occurred to me that the Spanish word for "and" ("y") is much more symbolic than the plain old english word "and". The "y" describes two lines converging into one line, the joining of two things is the perfect way to say "and". </p>

<p>This is also the day I ate <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2007/07/miracle-fruit-1.html">Miracle Fruit</a>. I forgot to find out if there was any sort of hallucinogenic properties associated with it, because that "y" thing I wrote about above is total stoner thinking. </p>
