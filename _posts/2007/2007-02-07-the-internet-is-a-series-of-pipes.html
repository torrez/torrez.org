Yahoo has apparently <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">done something </a>nobody seemed to be able to do right. They've managed to create a metaphor for consuming and processing XML that people can actually understand and use and build things with.</p>

<p>Did I say things? I meant applications. This is what <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a> should have been or what <a href="http://plagger.org/trac">Plagger</a> does but does without all the baggage of the little orange XML icon. </p>
