<p>I'm not one for dream analyzation and whatnot, but two nights in a row <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">Jesse Thorn</a> has visited me in my dream and told me creatively I was a failure. I am not sure what that means, or why he has done that, but it actually affected me today on my ride to work. </p>

<p>It's possibly related to anxiety over playing live this weekend, plus being almost thirty-five, plus watching all the projects I used to work on slowly die off. I actually had a serious offer from someone to to buy one of them, but have been too busy to clean it up and deliver it. </p>

<p>I'm also catching up on TSOYA podcasts of old, so maybe there's something in there. Either way, Jesse Thorn must be stopped. I'm cre8ive, dammit.</p>
