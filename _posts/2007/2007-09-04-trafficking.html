<p>Someone recently asked me for advice on publishing a weblog. The same old question everyone wants to know the answer to: how can I get the stellar $100k a month, smoke a cigar made of cash people have stuck in their sweaty trousers, traffic?</p>

<p>Considering I just consulted <a href="http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=notes.torrez.org/&amp;url=notes.torrez.org/">Alexa</a> and my site ranks 831,629 (note: that's not two numbers, 831 and 629, that's one WHOLE number! I know...I was surprised too) I am probably not an authority.</p>

<p>My guess as to why they asked me has more to do with <a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/" title="We're hiring!">where I work</a> and <a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/authors/index" title="sorta">who I know</a>. </p>

<p>So my advice was based purely on my observations of people who know what the hell they're doing:</p>

<ol>
<li>Publish often.</li>
<li>Write about stuff you like but have some focus. Be yourself. Find your voice. Yadda.</li>
<li>Link like a motherfucker.</li>
<li>Open comments when appropriate. Or, never open comments forcing people to publish responses on their own site.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've never paid attention to my stats. Just this past weekend I spent some time refreshing after <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/august#fri-31-mj" title="swoon">DaringFireball linked me</a>. So I decided I should test out my theory about traffic starting today.</p>

<p>In one month if I'm not ranked better than 800,000...well...I'm gonna buy a text ad.</p>
