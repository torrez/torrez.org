<p>I was offered the chance to buy a <a href="http://www.chumby.com/">Chumby</a> in what they're calling the <a href="http://www.chumby.com/store">insider release</a> phase of Chumby sales. I can't decide if I really want to get one. At just under $200 it seems like a very large expense for what would potentially be a second monitor on my desk. </p>

<p>If I'm not sitting at my desk at work I'm sitting on my couch with my laptop. And if I'm not at either of those places I surely will have my iTelephone on me. While I'd love to write something for it, I'd much rather take the new Leopard dev tools for a spin or work on some super-sekrit project of my own that I will own.</p>

<p>Plus there seems to be some <a href="http://www.bogost.com/blog/chumby_and_the_rhetoric_of_ope.shtml">kooky licensing issues</a> with Chumby that seems to boil down to "I can only GPL my work or they own it". A Chumby right now seems like an extravagant attention sink with little reward.</p>
