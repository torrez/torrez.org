I just converted my Flickr Account to my Yahoo ID. It took longer to find my old Yahoo account, get the password reset, marvel at the complete ball of shit that Yahoo.com proper is, notice all my email at my old Yahoo address was deleted (that's a &quot;kewl&quot; feature they got there), than to click this button:

I always thought the job Six Apart did in acquiring LiveJournal was terrific. The most passionate, opinionated group of users on the planet seemed to (afaik) accept the purchase and appearance of ads with hardly a whimper. Of course, it's possible I wasn't paying attention, but it seemed to be very much a non-issue and I think the people at Six Apart and LiveJournal are the reason why it didn't become a fotolog-style blowup.
