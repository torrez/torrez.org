Awful story of <a href="http://www.maczot.com/">MacZOT's</a> Brian Ball taking advantage of Garrett. The part that is amazing is Brian knew he was going to default on it, continued to sell it and ignore Garrett so he could weasel out of the contract. Not only that, Brian has the gall to claim it was (at $5,000) "OVER-VALUED".
