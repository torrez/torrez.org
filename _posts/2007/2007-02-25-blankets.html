Continuing my comic frenzy, I woke up this morning at 8am and finished "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankets_%28graphic_novel%29">Blankets</a>" by Craig Thompson. <a href="http://http://emptyage.honan.net/">Mat</a> recommended it the other day and I really had no idea what I was getting in to. It's won a shit-tonne of awards, so there's no use in me going on about how great it is but I feel so satisfied and peaceful after putting it down.
