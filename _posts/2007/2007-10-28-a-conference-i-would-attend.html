title: A Conference I Would Attend
category: Current Affairs

<p>I'm not much of a conference goer. I find web conferences terribly frustrating as I sit in my seat and think "I should be programming" or "In the time we all talked about this we could have pair programmed something interesting." Conferences in general just make me anxious.</p>

<p>But this conference titled <a href="http://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/containers/">The Traveling Box: Containers as a Global Icon of our Era</a> fascinates me to no end. I would so go to that conference. It even includes <a href="http://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/containers/boxconference_schedule.html">a tour of San Pedro</a>! </p>
