<p>You'll notice I have a slight advertising/marketing bent in things I link. I like companies, their brands, and how companies use their brands to interact with their customers or potential customers. I hate advertising without focus. I am not a fan of pretty much any contextual or behavioral schemes I see day-to-day. </p>

<p>There are two advertising campaigns right now that I keep running into on the web. The  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a>" <a href="http://www.1-18-08.com/">viral marketing campaign</a>, and the fun and far-reaching campaign revolving around the Simpsons' movie. Below I have a link to a story about the <a href="http://redcarpetfashionawards.blogspot.com/2007/07/linda-evangelista-and-simpsons-do-paris.html">Simpsons appearing in Harper's Bazaar</a>, and no doubt you've heard of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rdr07/sets/72157600590001691/">Simpons/7-11 Kwik-E-Mart</a> project in which 7-11 stores were converted to Kwik-E-Marts as seen on the Simpsons' TV Show.</p>

<p>I like both of these because they took effort and it shows (though the jury is still out on whether Cloverfield is <a href="http://www.montyfood.com/2007/07/1-18-08-aka-cloverfield-aka-slusho.html">masterfully architected or entirely botched</a>. Paramount goons are throwing around C+Ds <a href="http://www.montyfood.com/2007/07/1-18-08cloverfieldslusho-update.html">everywhere I look</a>). </p>

<p>Everyone lauds the death of print media, traditional publishing paradigms, the music industry, DRM...but I'm most happy to see the death of rewarding advertisers for shitty, thoughtless campaigns. I think it's something we've all known for a while: treat your customers to something engaging and they'll reward you with an appearance in their link list and possibly a ticket to your movie.</p>
