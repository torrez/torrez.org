<p><a href="http://www.mlarson.org/2007/10/31/why-its-hard-to-get-ready-for-work/">Why it's hard to get ready for work</a>. I have this same problem. Unless you know me in person you probably don't know I own nearly 30 plain, black t-shirts. </p>

<p>During the tough building phase of <a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/">FM</a> I was so pre-occupied with work that I honestly could not dress myself in the morning. It became one more thing I had to think about so I decided to fix it by buying a hell of a lot of plain t-shirts I could just throw on every day and get to work.</p>

<p>Plus I have this whole brand-aversion/addiction issue that just gets worse the older I get.</p>
