<p><a href="http://www.passion-pictures.com/flash.html#page=p2&amp;video=v638">The final product</a> for the latest Sony Bravia ad is good, but I don't think it is obvious that they had <a href="http://www.notcot.com/archives/2007/08/bravia_play_doh.php">real sculpted bunnies being swapped in and out</a> by dozens of animators. </p>

<p>Watching the above ad after <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z45lGbVePk8">the teaser</a> made me appreciate it more.</p>
