<p>While packing for our trip I found my Lomo squashed between two books. I do carry an iPhone and can take thousands of 2MP photos, but I want another film camera simply because <a href="http://www.smellsfunny.net/" title="Film is not dead it just smells funny">I still like using film</a>. I enjoy taking a camera out specifically to go take photos, though, I'd happily switch to digital if I could find one as utilitarian and durable (mostly) as the Lomo. It just felt nice to use.</p>

<p>I would never drop $5k <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000J6FTVU/nutshell-20">on this Leica</a>, but I'd definitely go digital for something similar to that.</p>

<p>Related: <a href="http://www.justinsomnia.org/">Justin</a> pointed me to the White Stripes branded <a href="http://www.whitestripes.com/lomography/lomography.html">Diana+ and Holga</a> cameras.  Eh?</p>
