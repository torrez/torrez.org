<p>I like the composition of <a href="http://kenmeier.info/movies/jkm_space.mov">this short bio of Yuri Gagarin and Alan Shepard</a>. It would be interesting to see many people featured this way: some passing away on the left and new people in history being born on the right. found on <a href="http://www.coudal.com/">coudal</a>.</p>
