<p>I saw <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2007/09/24/intv.virgin.flickr.lawsuit.cnn">this story</a> about a photo used in a Virgin Mobile ad that acquired a photo from a Flickr user. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chewywong/467623403/">The photo in question</a> has now been switched to a strict copyright, but it previously existed with a Creative Commons license that permitted commercial use.</p>

<p>Outside of a model release, I think it's interesting to see a mostly clueful company "linking back" to the Flickr source in their ad per the CC license, and lawyers and Flickr license grantors mostly clueless about what that license means.</p>
