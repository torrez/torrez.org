He's a barber and a damn good one. I need to find a local barber that is half as good as him. The $20 haircut I keep getting is a disaster compared to what my dad does.<br /><br />We spent the weekend with my parents. It was 100ยบ. I forgot how draining 100ยบ weather can be. <br /><br />And that was my weekend.<br clear="all" /></p>
