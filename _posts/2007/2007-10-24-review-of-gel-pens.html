<p>Michael <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/10/16/the_gel_dilemma.html">reviews some gel pens</a>. I was a G2 user for a long time, but recently bought a big box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Retractable-Medium-Point/dp/B00006JNIF/nutshell-20">Zebra Sarasas</a> and have been pretty happy with them, though they do tend to randomly give a little too much ink sometimes.</p>

<p>Add me to the list of people who gets happy when they go to an office supply store. I have more paper, pens, tape, and office doo-hickeys than food in my fridge. I may not survive the weeks following an earthquake but I could supply a small government agency for a year on my supplies.</p>
