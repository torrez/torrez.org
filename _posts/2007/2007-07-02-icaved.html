<p>I got an iPhone. Well...Amber went <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dahliablack/695742719/">early this morning</a> and picked up two 8 gig iPhones for us, so technically I don't have it yet. But I pretty much decided I was going to cave eventually, so why not just get it over with?</p>

<p>I hate buying 1st generation Apple products, but after reading reviews, and hearing friends talk highly of it I decided the 1st gen curse might not apply to this one. </p>

<p>My current phone (for the next hour or so) is the k790a. It's the best phone I've ever owned. The 3.2 megapixel camera is reason enough to own it, and <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2006/11/review-sony-ericsson-k790a.html">Cabel's review</a> is the reason I bought it unlocked for $400. </p>

<p>Oddly enough Cabel referred to the unannounced iPhone in his review way back in November 2006, three months before it was revealed: <em>"And, of course, now that I bought this phone, Apple should be releasing the iPhone any minute now. Thank me later."</em> Thanks, Cabel.</p>

<p>I'm excited to try out two todo lists: <a href="http://dopointoh.com/">dopointoh.com</a> and <a href="http://tadalist.com/">tadalist.com</a>. Until they open up the platform for development, there's going to be a fun little burst of web apps like what <a href="http://davidcann.com/iPhonify/GoogleReader/">David Cann</a> <a href="http://davidcann.com/iphone/">is</a> <a href="http://www.publictivity.com/iPhoneChat/">doing</a>. </p>

<p>So in conclusion: fun times, fancy phone, and I like to think there's a bathroom or storage closet in Steve's house I've completely paid for (except he draws a salary of $1 so maybe that episode of Ugly Betty I grabbed a couple weeks ago took care of that).</p>
