<p>Ben Brown and Katie Spence have a new site up called <a href="http://www.iwanttoseethat.com/">I Want To See That!</a> The purpose of the site is to get you and your friends to get out and actually see movies. <a href="http://podcast.iwanttoseethat.com/">There's a podcast</a> for the site where Ben and Katie talk about the upcoming movies even though they haven't seen them. It turns out to be really compelling to watch and I'm already looking forward to each episode. </p>

<p><em>Note: I accidentally posted a rambling piece late last night that was supposed to be a draft. Whoops!</em></p>
