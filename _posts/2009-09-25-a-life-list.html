<p><a href="http://mightygirl.com/2009/09/25/rolling-a-kayak-the-movie/">Maggie Mason learns how to roll a kayak</a>. If you haven't been following this Intel has been sponsoring Mightygirl.com to run through her <a href="http://www.mightygirl.net/mighty-life-list/">life list</a> (a list of things she's always wanted to do in life). </p>

<p>Anyway, the first few seconds of that video on the kayak are why "rolling a kayak" is going on my "never in my life list".</p>

<p>NOTE: Federated Media (my employer and a company I co-founded 275 years ago) is the company that brokered this campaign. So in fairness, I should point out that I am linking to something that is in some part beneficial to me and my family. </p>

<p>Intel makes you taller.</p>
