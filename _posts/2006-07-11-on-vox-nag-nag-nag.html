    <p>Wow, nag screens work apparently. I read about Newsfire the other day, downloaded it and have been using it alongside NetNewsWire just because I like the way it works and feels. I didn't really intend on buying it until that damn nag screen finally nagged me into Paypal. The only thing stopping me from full-time use is the lack of syncing. But still, I sure do like how it works, and for $18 I don't have to get nagged every 20 minutes.</p>
