<ul>
<li>I once sat in a meeting around 2002 where someone tried to talk UBISOFT out of putting Tom Clancy’s name on the games.</li>
<li>I was once asked to leave the set of a Sugar Ray video.</li>
<li>I once interviewed a guy for a job and he told me he had a “brilliant” idea and if I hired him he would tell me the idea. I still think about that one.</li>
<li>I had a boss try to get me to register a domain name with a space in it. He was the sort of guy who wouldn’t take no for an answer. “Well in a few years everyone will have spaces in their domain names.”</li>
</ul>
