<p><a href="http://www.notcot.com/giftguide07/">Notcot's 2007 Gift Guide</a> is already off to a good start. Keep checking back as she reveals new products each day. (I want that Mozart ball thing for no reason other than it's made of wood and has a wind-up)</p>

<p>It's been fun following <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monitormix/2007/11/favorites.html">Carrie Brownstein's</a> weblog over on NPR. I keep meaning to link to it but forget. She did a gift guide so now I get to. I love when people write on their site like they're writing me a letter. I can't think of any better advice to new weblog authors. (I forget who gave that to me)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.popmatters.com/pm/blogs/consumingconsumables/">PopMatters' Consuming Consumables</a> will also be updated right up until the Holidays.</p>
