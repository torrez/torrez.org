title: Future of (my) Web Apps

<p>I pulled my head out of MLKSHK the last two months and had a bit of a revelation about the future of web apps&#8212;at least, any web app I work on in my future. I present to you my new starting markup:</p>

<p>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</p>

<p>Well, throw a &lt;head&gt; tag in there pointing to some JavaScript (generated by CoffeeScript of course) and perhaps a DIV with an id of “app” and that’s about it. I just don‘t see a need to manage “page” markup when so much of my markup is now in jQuery templates/snippets I can swap out very easily. </p>

<p>I resisted hash-bang paths and client-side apps for so long until I started working on a project where it made perfect sense. Since then I’ve just gotten more comfortable with the idea because:</p>

<ol>
<li>It’s easier for me to think about the server-side app as an API with your browser-view one type of client. Side-effect: your mobile app just got easier to make.</li>
<li>This divides testing into server side and client side. Working on the UI doesn’t mean you have to flip over to the server-side tests to ensure it’s working.</li>
<li>I think I love CoffeeScript.</li>
<li>Marshalling data for a specific view is tedious.</li>
</ol>

<p>I feel like separating these clients from the back-end means less time tinkering with data as it moves from your db out to your views. There is so much traversing code when you build a site and I now think if you can cut your trips into smaller loops you‘ll spend less time wrestling with data, markup, and CSS (boring) and more time writing useful functionality (fun!).</p>
