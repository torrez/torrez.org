<p><a href="http://www.thomascrampton.com/2007/09/06/how-to-be-an-uber-blogger-by-cory-doctorow/">Cory Doctorow gives some advice on how to write a weblog</a>. I think the underlying message is be mindful of your reader when you write anything. Which is solid advice.</p>

<p>Since the titles of my posts are hidden in my new design, I decided to get really clever with them. Cory reminded me why this is a bad idea and I've decided to go back to more friendly ones that get to the point. I forgot about RSS readers and the titles are only really funny if you've already read the post.</p>
