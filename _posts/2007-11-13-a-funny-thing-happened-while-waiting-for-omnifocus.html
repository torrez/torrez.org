<p>Sometime in the spring I saw a demo of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> and got really excited about it. I've been doing a modified GTD with text files and folders for a couple years now and was interested in stepping up to a system with a little more smarts. </p>

<p>While waiting for the release I discovered something that has proven to work <em>very</em> well for task tracking. It's called <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a> and when mixed with .Mac's iDisk it's just the right amount of functionality on top of my current system to do what I had hoped to do with OmniFocus.</p>

<p>The core of TaskPaper is text files. If you were to open up a .taskpaper file you'd find it completely readable and not-unlike what you'd type if you were just managing the text files by hand. The app is a very light-weight text editor that has a couple features that help you sort, search, and mark items as complete in your todo lists.</p>
