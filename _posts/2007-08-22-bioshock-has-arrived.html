<p>Got my copy of <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/bioshock">Bioshock</a> today. It's staring at me from across my desk. "Take me home! Take me hoooooome!"</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-SSu3tJ3ns">YouTube - Content-Aware Image Sizing [EN]</a> - This is awesome, but I thought this already existed. Hm. Found at <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/">http://binarybonsai.com/</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rtmfd/1097058025/">&quot;The Slide&quot; on Flickr - Photo Sharing!</a> - Wow, I totally missed this controversy. How did I miss this controversy? I read blogs. Lots of blogs. Maybe not enough blogs. Found on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">http://daringfireball.net/</a>. I'd like to say I would have walked out but I probably would have given him the benefit of the doubt like everyone else did.</li>
