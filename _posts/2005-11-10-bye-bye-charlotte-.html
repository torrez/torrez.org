title: bye bye, charlotte.

<p>
I've been following <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/11/i_am_getting_an.html">Michael's frustration</a> with that new Tom Wolfe book "I Am Charlotte Simmons". He finally finished it and <a href="http://sippey.typepad.com/filtered/2005/11/bye_bye_charlot.html">threw it across the room anyway</a>.

<p>
Something I decided long ago with books, movies, and video games is that there is just too much good stuff out there to not move on to something else. I used to slog  through things that angered me, but now I just put them away, or send them back to Netflix or Gamefly.
</p>
<p>
This past weekend I tried my first <a href="http://www.gamefly.com/" title="Netflix for Video Games">GameFly</a> game called "<a href="http://www.gamefly.com/products/detail.asp?pid=110560">Geist</a>", a game I had been tempted to buy because for some reason I think first person shooters would be fun on my Gamecube. (The GC controller being a favorite for two-stick movement.)
</p>
<p>
By the third boss I was so over the game. For the same reason a lot of games lose me, I can figure out <em>what</em> I'm supposed to do, but either the controls or the AI is so impossibly frustrating that I feel like I'm being punished. After 40 minutes of trying to get the perfect shot off, I gave up and sent the game back.
</p>
<p>
I just value my time too much now to put myself through some frustrating piece of media I'm supposed to be enjoying.

<h3>GameFly</h3>
<p>
I've been thinking a lot about the big three (books, movies, video games), about the pricing and value you get back. Video games, because of their price, always demanded a larger amount of patience.
</p>
<p>
Now that I've signed up for GameFly, and I don't have to drop $50 on something I'm going to be frustrated with, I feel a little empowered to just move on to the next game if I'm bothered by something. I think I might start enjoying games less because I'm not forcing myself to get past a particularly frustrating level.
