While contemplating how I'm going to use my new iPod shuffle, I came across <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/smartdeck/index.php">this cassette adapter</a> ("with a brain", they say). Use the controls on your cassette player to control your iPod. One of the reasons I stopped listening to my iPod in the car was having to fumble for the device to move about. Now I can use the controls that are on my steering wheel.
