title: Play Me Later
category: Games

<p>I have started tagging games I want to play or games that I want to check-in on later with the tag: <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:torrez/t:playmelater/">playmelater</a> on Pinboard. A while back I registered the domain name playmelater.com to make something like a Svpply for video games, but I doubt I will ever get to it.</p>

<p>It’s something I do want. I hope someone makes it. Every week it feels like there are 10 new games to check out, and these aren’t just big publisher games but small independent games I will surely lose track of unless <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/brandonnn">@brandonnn</a> tweets about them.</p>
