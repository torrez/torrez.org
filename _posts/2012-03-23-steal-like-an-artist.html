<p>A few weeks ago, standing at baggage claim with my family, I checked Twitter to see <a href="http://austinkleon.com">Austin Kleon</a> mentioning me with a screenshot I didn’t recognize of <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2011/04/an-empathetic-plan.html">something I wrote here a bit ago</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Quote from @<a href="https://twitter.com/torrez">torrez</a>! RT @<a href="https://twitter.com/AdvanceUrSlides">AdvanceUrSlides</a>: A little taste of the awesomesauce in @<a href="https://twitter.com/austinkleon">austinkleon</a>'s Steal Like An Artist. <a href="http://t.co/mjWe7Ilk" title="http://bit.ly/xpVYdD">bit.ly/xpVYdD</a></p>&mdash; Austin Kleon (@austinkleon) <a href="https://twitter.com/austinkleon/status/176413501298982912" data-datetime="2012-03-04T21:07:10+00:00">March 4, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>Totally out of context, I had no idea what was going on. By the time we were in our car I discovered Austin had used the line from <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2011/04/an-empathetic-plan.html">that blog post</a> in his book “<a href="http://www.austinkleon.com/steal/">Steal Like an Artist</a>”. </p>

<p>Now a few weeks on, after reading the book, I can say I am so unbelievably proud to have such a tiny part to do with that book. It’s a subject I have talked about with friends, but never with the clarity and precision Austin does in this book. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761169253/andretorrez-20/ref=nosim/">You should buy this book</a>. You should <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761169253/andretorrez-20/ref=nosim/">buy two copies</a> of this book because someone is going to borrow your copy and never give it back to you.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to write a book. I have these little ideas and thoughts I end up either throwing here or launching into over beers with friends. I also have had these thoughts about taste and how just simply having it and knowing you have it is good enough to get started. But this book is better than the book I could have written on that subject. </p>

<p>So maybe I never get to write <em>that</em> book, but holy crap am I happy to know I have a couple inches of space in the book that so perfectly nails it.</p>
