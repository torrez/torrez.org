<p><a href="http://andialbrecht.wordpress.com/2009/05/09/when-merging-fails/">This is a hilarious project.</a> It takes a picture via your webcam the moment your merge fails and posts it to Twitpic and Twitter.</p>

<p>(For the non-tech, this is when you merge the branch of code you've been working on with the main code base. When it fails you have to pick through it like a fisherman undoing a bad cast. It usually happens 10 minutes before your train is supposed to leave the office.)</p>
