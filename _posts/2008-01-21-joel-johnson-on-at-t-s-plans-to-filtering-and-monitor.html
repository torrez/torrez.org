<p><a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/01/21/talking-about-atts-i.html">Joel Johnson went on The Hugh Thompson (who?) Show</a> and talked about AT&amp;T's <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2182152/fr/rss/">recent announcement to start filtering/monitoring Internet traffic</a>. The thing is, The Hugh Thompson show is <strong>sponsored by AT&amp;T</strong>, which is probably why the clip ends with a booming voice saying "HOLD PLEASE" and taping is stopped.</p>
