My sister and I have always called it &quot;Memorail Day&quot; due to the fact that the town we grew up in had a park called Memorial Park, and next to it a store that mistakenly (I think) spelled their name &quot;<a href="http://lisey.typepad.com/photos/delano/memorail.html">Memorail Park Grocery</a>&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The store's fa√ßade underwent a series of facelifts through the years, but the name has always stayed the same.
