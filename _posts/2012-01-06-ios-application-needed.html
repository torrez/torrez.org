<p>Someone make this: an iOS app with protocol handler “camera://” that lets me pass a URL for the application to post an image to.</p>

<p>Every web app that needs an iOS app just to get a photo or image into the site could use this non-site-specific iOS app by simply passing in something like:</p>

<p>camera://url=http://some.com/new-image/token/asdf1234</p>

<p>The app launches, user selects image or takes a photo, and then the iOS app posts that image data to the URL passed in via url=...</p>

<p>Now anyone with a web app can offer image uploading as long as that community camera/image picker is installed.</p>
