<p>Ben Brown and Katie Spence (the husband and wife team that previously brought you the very funny and cute <a href="http://hooraymovies.com/blog/">iwanttoseethatparticularmovieyougotthere podcast</a>) are launching a movie super-site dedicated to all movies on DVD, silver screen, BluRays, and surely <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/10/megamovies-tv-shows-as-dayslong-movies">day-long movies</a> as well (timely!), for you to categorize and store for later.</p>

<p>It's called <a href="http://hooraymovies.com">HOORAY MOVIES!</a></p>

<p>And the best part: many kinds of data feeds for the mishing and the mashing of movies for you to build things on top of their data.</p>
