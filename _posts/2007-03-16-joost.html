<p><img src="http://notes.torrez.org/images/Picture 6.png" border="0" height="69" width="187" alt="Picture 6.png" align="right" />I've got two <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> invites about to expire. Joost is neat. Joost is flashy. Joost has no content I care to watch and makes my computer go VAHRRROOOOOOOOM and burn my lap. </p>

<p>But maybe you have a nicer computer than I. So if you'd like an invite, send me <s>an email at andre.torrez@gmail.com and I'll invite you</s> all gone. But remember: Macbook 2GHz w/2 gigs of RAM + Joost = red thighs.</p>
