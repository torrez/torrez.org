<p><img border="0" src="http://torrez.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/picture_2.png" title="Picture_2" alt="Picture_2" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />I didn't get to into it in my last post, but the other part of <a href="http://coffeebreakspanish.typepad.com/">Coffee Break Spanish</a> that impresses me is their adoption of good tools. </p>

<p>Their blog is run off of <a href="http://coffeebreakspanish.typepad.com/">TypePad,</a> an excellent blogging service&nbsp; for businesses. I use TypePad specifically because I don't have to maintain or troubleshoot an installation, and frankly I don't have time in my life to fret over a bad database index or some dumb PERL requirement. Oh, I could run MT or Wordpress, and I know there are cool little things I'd love to do with my blog, but really, TypePad just works. I think this is why it's been such a hit with businesses who don't want to call up the IT guy every time something goes wrong with the blog.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with the many podcast services and directories they use except for <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=201598403">iTunes</a>, but I can imagine they all increase awareness in their own way. And it looks like they use Feedburner to track it all which is very smart. </p>

<p>They sell course materials through <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal,</a> and printed shirts and clocks through <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/radiolingua/">Cafepress</a>. For community boards they use <a href="http://www.readybb.com/coffeebreakspanish/">ReadyBB</a> which is hosted PHPBB.<br /> </p>

<p>Finally, they are paying attention to their listeners. Not long after I posted about finding their podcast, Mark,&nbsp; the teacher, was in the comments so you know he's watching Technorati or at least the iTunes referrer log as I didn't link his site directly.</p>

<p>It's a 3rd party tool success story if there ever was one. As a web developer I'm interested in seeing where they take this, as a student I feel like I'm in good hands.<br /> </p>
