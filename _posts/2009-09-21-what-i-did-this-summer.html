<p>At work we (me and <a href="http://yizzle.com/">Andy Yang</a>) built <a href="http://mashable.com/trends/">this Trend Tracker for Mashable</a>. </p>

<p>Mashable's intro: <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/mashable-trends/">http://mashable.com/2009/09/21/mashable-trends/</a></p>

<p>The idea is it pulls in a Twitter account's timeline, unpacks short URLs, collects Flickr/TwitPic/Youtube media, matches statuses against Twitter's trending topics, and ranks top re-tweeted URLs that point back to Mashable's site. </p>

<p>In other versions of our app we rank links being shared and other neat bits of data. More on that later. </p>

<p>They always say build the app you want for yourself and this is definitely it. My own tracker runs on my laptop and every day I get a growing list of trends and links of people I'm following.</p>

<p>Last week I was pretty well sick of Kanye, you jerks.</p>
