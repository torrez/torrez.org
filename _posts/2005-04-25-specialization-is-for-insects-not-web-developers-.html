I had never heard <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RobertHeinlein">this quote</a> from Heinlein before. The astoundingly appropriate quote for today showed up in <a href="http://www.sfist.com/archives/2005/04/21/bay_blogger_thursday.php">this interview with George Kelly</a>.

Good quote for my first day back at work where there's a lot of people running around with their only hammer smashing everything like it's a nail.
