<p>Amber and I ended up at Needles and Pens this weekend and I turned the corner into the art gallery wall to <a href="http://www.bluno.org/2008/02/10/of-skateboards-and-copy-machines/">find ZINES</a>. And not just zines, but SKATE ZINES. I actually recognized Tod Swank's zine, of course, and a few other names seemed to be familiar. </p>

<p>I must scan and upload my zine (MEGA zine) before our next move. At least the issue with my friend Justin on the cover, all teeth missing or bent outwards, and smiling like a dope. </p>
