title: Tweeting To My Neighbors

<p>A Twitter feature I’ve wanted to see for a long time is the ability to geo-tag (assign a location) to my tweet and have it only be posted to people’s streams who are in that location.</p>

<p>That is, I tag my tweet for San Francisco and only people who follow me <em>and</em> have set their location for San Francisco can see my tweet.</p>

<p>The tweet should be viewable to anyone who were to look at <a href="http://twitter.com/torrez">my profile</a> and it can be retweeted and favored like any other tweet. The difference is that it wouldn’t be <em>posted</em> to people’s streams that haven't chosen to listen to that location. Giving me comfort in knowing I’m not flooding people’s timelines in snowy New England with photos of another ridiculous California sunset.</p>

<p>Anyway, feature requests are really easy to throw out at teams building products when you aren’t inside. It’s just a feature I would love to see someday. Twitter has always operated on one level and I think it would be a nice option to have a second layer I could feel comfortable posting into.</p>
