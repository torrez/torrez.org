Hi, I am annoying software that, when you attempt to uninstall will error out and tell you to mail someone.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and every day, even when you're not using it, I will bother you with a message saying you've used the app (even though you haven't).
</p>
<p>
Does anyone know any good software that will record screencasts and is not bothersome?
</p>
