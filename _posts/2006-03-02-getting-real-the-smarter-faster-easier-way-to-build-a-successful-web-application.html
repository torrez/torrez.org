37signals asked a bunch of web developers to write  some introductions to chapters and I was  one of those asked. Of course, I realize they realize that I'd be linking back to them when it was all finished saying "holy crap, I'm in a book!" and well...holy crap, I'm in a book!

And, just to give 37signals their full money's worth, I won't even tell you what I wrote. You have to go <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">buy your own copy</a>.
