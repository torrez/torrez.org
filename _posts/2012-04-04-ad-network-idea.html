title: Ad Network Idea
category: Web/Tech
---
<p>I’ve been thinking about ad networks a bit more. Ad Tech is this week and an <a href="http://jonschreiber.org/photos/">old co-worker</a> stopped by my office and we ended up talking about them. Then <a href="http://justinsomnia.org">Justin</a>, another former co-worker at <a href="http://federatedmedia.net/">Federated Media</a>, posted <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/">this discovery last night</a>. (Justin and I talk about ad serving a lot. Too much probably)</p>

<p>So I had this idea. I think it is a good and simple one for normal people with weblogs.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Ad network for your weblog where all the ads all have your personal affiliate ID in them. Dropbox. Amazon. iTunes. Netflix. Etc…</p>&mdash; Andre Torrez (@torrez) <a href="https://twitter.com/torrez/status/187617518578438144" data-datetime="2012-04-04T19:07:56+00:00">April 4, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>The short of it is I like the idea of running a tasteful, small ad on my site like the ads from <a href="http://decknetwork.net/">The Deck</a>. But I realize using some fly-by-night penny ad network for punching monkeys really just opens you, my readers, to what those ads are really doing: tracking you with cookies. Or worse: installing malware.</p>

<p>The old joke is nobody clicks ads, but the truth is their business is not just getting you to click an ad. Their business is to set or read a cookie (or allow another unnamed party who bids high enough to) and then sell or merge that information with other databases so they can really target you later on. </p>

<p>Install <a href="http://ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a> and you will see some of your favorite sites (that’s Techcrunch on the right) are serving you a mess of tracking codes that you really don’t think about because it’s happening behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I have volumes I could write on the subject of ads, ad networks, and cookies. But the what this post is about is simply a desire for more options that work for everyone, publishers, advertisers, and readers. They are rare.</p>
