<p>
It's one thing to see your recent ex-girlfriend's online personal ad on some dating web site...it's a whole other bag of tamales to see it <a href="http://www.esquire.com/brutal/profile.html?single=7">IN THE PAGES OF ESQUIRE MAGAZINE</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's cool though, we're friends, and I totally support her. Even though I come off as a bad guy for breaking up with her the day before Valentine's Day (which fell on Friday the 13th this year) I don't really mind.
</p>
<p>
On Friday at 9am she's going to be on <a href="http://www.kroq.com/">the #1 morning radio show in LA</a> discussing the article. So tune in to hear me get beat up on the radio, I guess.
</p>
<p>
She's cool. I love her. She had more of an influence on my life than any other girlfriend or friend I ever had. I've got my fingers crossed that maybe this will open a door or two for her. She deserves it.
