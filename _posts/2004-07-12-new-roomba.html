<p>
The <a href="http://www.newroomba.net/">new Roombas</a> were announced today. The coolest feature being the ability for the Roomba (named "Discovery") to drive back to its base station and re-charge itself. Current owners of Roomba were given the ability to pre-order and get theirs first, but I think I'll wait.
