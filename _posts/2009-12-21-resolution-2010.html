<p>Every year I make a new year's resolution that sound nearly impossible. I enjoy the challenge of putting a goal in front of me that at the beginning of the year seems entirely ridiculous, but at the end of the year seems completely doable. </p>

<p>The best resolutions I've made are rarely about <em>doing</em> something, they're usually the challenge of <em>restricting</em> or cutting out something in my life&#8212;usually involving the act of media consumption. Self-portait-a-day projects sound fun, but I am far too forgetful to remember to take a picture of my dumb face. I see it enough already. </p>

<p>A couple of years ago I decided not to buy a book the entire year. When I started it seemed completely insane. I love books. I was commuting 45 minutes both ways by bus or boat at the time, and books were a favorite diversion. I finally broke down and made a rule that let me buy comic books, but it did create this reason for me to dive back into books I'd already read, and finish some I had given up on. </p>

<p>The following year I tried it with video games. I couldn't buy a new video game until I had played through every unfinished game I had sitting on my shelf. I wasn't able to keep that one. Some of those games were really terrible.</p>

<p>Last year I vowed to finish five projects or let the domains I had purchased for them expire, which was heartbreaking because I had some good domain names. I was  unsuccessful launching those projects and the domains expired.</p>

<p>While I was walking to work this morning I came up with my next resolution for 2010. I was listening to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Le+Tigre">Le Tigre's</a> self-titled album (now 10 years old), and flipped to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Operation_Ivy">Operation Ivy's</a> (now 20 years old). Then on the walk from the Embarcadero I switched to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+xx">the xx</a> (1 year old) and it struck me how I've probably missed a lot of good music because I was spending it listening to old <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Modern+Lovers">Modern Lovers</a> records.</p>

<p>So then it hit me: what if I only listened to music released in 2010? Okay. That's just crazy enough.</p>

<p>The rules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>This includes re-issues/re-masters. </li>
<li>For the month of January I am allowed to listen to anything from 2009.</li>
<li>I will probably come up with more rules as I think of them because not listening to Bad Brains for a year is starting to make me sad.</li>
</ul>

<p>And you can play along at home if you'd like: <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/torrez">here is my last.fm</a> stream. It has over 50,000 songs I've listened to over the past few years. <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/torrez/library">The top 18</a> has 11 bands that <strong>aren't even bands</strong> anymore (counting Weezer).</p>
