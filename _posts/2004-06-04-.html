It used to be one of the first things I installed when setting up a new machine. I write way more CLI PHP than PERL these days. :)</li>
<!-- <li>For the second time this week someone has emailed me about suggestions for software to run a commercial blog they want to start. Is the MT hubub is still confusing people so much they'd rather not deal with it&#8212;or at least to the point of not wanting to bother to go back and read the new licensing options? I asked one of them why they didn't bother with MT and he basically said he didn't want to invest in something if he wasn't going to make enough for him to even pay the licensing fee. He just didn't know if the idea was sound. It's too bad there isn't a grace period to get everything set up and running for a few months like the 30-day TypePad trial. Maybe he just needs to add advertising later.</li>-->
