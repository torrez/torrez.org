title: Update On My 2012 Project

<p>Only listening to music from 2012 so far: sucks. I pretty much stayed away from 2011, but only a couple weeks into the new year and there is seriously nothing. Help me if you know something good, because I am dying over here. I heard the new Sleigh Bells way more than I could deal. And the Miniature Tigers new song is okay…but  not what I was hoping for. Come on new music Tuesday!</p>

<p>Meanwhile I decided I can’t stop participating over on <a href="http://thisismyjam.com/">This Is My Jam</a> because it’s just too much fun. So far I haven’t been able to share any new music with anyone over there, but I have my fingers crossed as we hit the end of the month and get past all the albums the labels dumped after the new year.</p>
