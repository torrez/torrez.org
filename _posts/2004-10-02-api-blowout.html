Alan of Kokogiak has <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/gedankengang/2004/10/announcing-amazon-light-4.html">launched</a> a new version of <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon4/">Amazon Lite</a>. This one takes advantage of the new Amazon 4.0 web services but also features some pretty cool tools. Each product page has a list of tools that allow you to make a Dropcash campaign, mail a link via Gmail, post the link to your Blogger page, add the page to your Del.icio.us links, and depending on the type of media, look up the book at the library, find the movie on Netflix, or find the artist in iTunes.
</p>
<p>
Those tools are great, but the one that got me most excited is the local library lookup. I don't use my library enough, and having that option right before I buy <em>another</em> book from Amazon is perhaps the coolest thing I've seen all year.

<!--<p>
The thing I'm really liking about APIs these days is that they give people like Alan, <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/">and me</a>, the ability to not just build on top of but repurpose functionality the way we think it should work. <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon4/cats.asp">This</a> is my kind of category page. And <a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/amazon4/default.asp?SearchIndex=Music&Keywords=silver%20jews&Asin=B00000AG9W">these collapsed reviews and track listings</a> keep everything in within view and within reach.
