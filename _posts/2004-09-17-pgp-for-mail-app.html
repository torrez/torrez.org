<p>
I had been meaning to <a href="http://www.davextreme.com/davextreme/2004/09/pgp_for_apple_m.html">set up PGP for Mail.app</a> for a while now. PGP is another one of those concepts that has always been out of reach of the average user. Only two people who regularly email me use PGP, and they're both programmers.
