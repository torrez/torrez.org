<p>Anil has launched a new site/idea that I am very much excited about. It's called <a href="http://lastyearsmodel.org/">Last Year's Model</a> and it's all about recognizing you don't need to get on the newest gadget treadmill that some gadget blogs and manufacturers would like you to believe.</p>

<p>Design is by <a href="http://www.muledesign.com/">Mule</a>, it's super fancy.</p>
