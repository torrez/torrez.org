This is like me and Amber watching NFL football.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Those graphics are hideous.</li>
<li>Are quarterbacks normally tall or fat or both? Our quarterback in high-school was 5'6&quot;!</li>
<li>How can the stadium be that close to the city?<em> huh?</em></li>
<li>I like those uniforms.</li>
<li>Has anyone ever died on the field?</li>
<li>Did you ever want to be a football player?</li>
<li><em>On Shannon Sharpe:</em> That man dresses well.</li>
</ul>
