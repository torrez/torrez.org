<p>I think I'm going to be linking to online stores and buying guides as we get closer to that day in December. The one near the end of the month. Ho ho ho.</p>

<p><a href="http://mightygoods.com/">Might Goods</a> has been pointing to excellent "stocking stuffers for grownups" and budget gift guides. </p>

<p>Did you know <a href="http://xkcd.com/store/">XKCD</a> has a store as well? The Internet posters are pretty cool, but the shirts...like most shirts I see on the web I can't imagine actually wearing one. Funny though.</p>
