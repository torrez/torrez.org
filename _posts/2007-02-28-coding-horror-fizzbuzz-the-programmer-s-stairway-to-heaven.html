Oh awful, after Jeff posted about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">the FizzBuzz problem</a> people actually started posting their own versions in some sort of sad compulsion to prove they were capable to write five lines of code. It's like someone said, "Everyone should know how to tie their shoe laces!" and a hundred people untied and tied their shoelaces to prove they could do it.
