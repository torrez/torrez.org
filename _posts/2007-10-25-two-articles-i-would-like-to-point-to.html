<p>Here are two articles I read today. You might like them. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/19532/page1/">Technology Review: What Is He Doing?</a> An article about Ev, Twitter, Blogger, and petting his cat. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/10/22/071022crmu_music_frerejones?currentPage=all">A Paler Shade of White</a>. I enjoyed reading this. Slightly related I still think that people who think music has gotten boring have gotten boring.</p>
