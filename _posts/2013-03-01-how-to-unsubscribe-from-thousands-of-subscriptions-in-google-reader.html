title: How To Unsubscribe From Thousands of Subscriptions in Google Reader

<p>Because I just figured this out after unsubscribing from over 2,000 sites I wanted to share how to do this.</p>

<p>Going into Manage Subscriptions, selecting all, and then clicking unsubscribe <strong>does not work</strong>. You get an error “Oops. ..an error occurred. Try again in a few seconds.” which is bad advice because it will always reply with that. It seems the limit is somewhere just below 200 subscriptions.</p>

<p>The trick turned out to be the filter/search box. You can use that to filter to something more manageable, like a 50 or so subscriptions, then selecting them all and unsubscribing.</p>

<p>I didn’t figure out to do this until I was at the M’s. I just typed “M” and the list was truncated to all feeds whose name began with the letter “M”.</p>
