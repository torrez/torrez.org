<p>I wrote a little jQuery plugin that does a Twitter search for the URL you are looking at and inserts the tweet and some links to favor, reply, or retweet that tweet.</p>

<p>Twitter Search results are only valid for 6-9 days so the blue box you see below will probably disappear within a week. You should maybe try it out. :)</p>
