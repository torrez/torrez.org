<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I've been away for a while, but now I'm back. Here is what happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>I left my job at Federated Media.</li>
<li>I started doing client work.</li>
<li>I realized I dislike client work. The "client" part of client work.</li>
<li>I worked on a secret project for someone else to be announced in a month. Kind of like client work but without jerky clients.</li>
<li>Made enough money the past few months to take a stab at a real-live start up with my wife.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.simpleform.com/">http://www.simpleform.com/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>PLEASE sign up for the Friends of Simpleform list. I promise there is very good news coming soon (like tomorrow).</p>
<p>Â </p>
