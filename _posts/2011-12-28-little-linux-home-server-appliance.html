<p>I just watched this video of the $25 <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> beta board (via <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/">jwatt</a>):</p>

<p>It reminded me of something I wish I could go out and buy right now. I want something the size of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E10KI8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004E10KI8">Jambox</a> but instead of an audio receiver and speakers inside, I want a tiny computer that is doing a number of things for me. </p>

<p>The first thing I’d want it to do is back-up files from our computers and then push them (delayed) to the cloud when I am at work or sleeping. </p>

<p>The second would be a web server I could use to develop apps for. I have these app ideas that I want to live in my house rather than on a server someplace I have to maintain. Things like address books and calendaring between my wife and I. Stuff I want to own, not depend on some outside service.</p>

<p>Don’t you want to buy that little box? I sure do.</p>

<p>Since I’m asking, another thing I want is an iPod Touch with everything it currently has PLUS a 3g data connection. I basically want my iPhone without a phone. Who needs to carry around a phone? (More on this later, maybe today).</p>

<p><em>Two helpful links arrived through Twitter after posting. First <a href="https://twitter.com/wezm">@wezm</a> points me to some <a href="http://pcengines.ch/alix2d13.htm">existing off the shelf boards</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pfibiger">@pfibiger</a> points out these are called “plug computers” and gives me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheevaPlug">a great link</a> to start learning more about them.</em></p>
