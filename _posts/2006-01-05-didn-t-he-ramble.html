As I was reading it, I started to realize that I grew up with people with some very interesting nicknames as well. Though I found it hard to remember all of them since to me they were just normal names.
</p>
<p>
There's my immediate family, my Uncle <strong>&quot;Quisi&quot;</strong> (Pete), Aunt <strong>&quot;Pinkie&quot;</strong> (Rachel), my dad is <strong>&quot;Chi-Chi&quot;</strong> (Alex). My mom is <strong>&quot;Lolie&quot;</strong> (Dolores).
</p>

<p>
I hung out with a guys named <strong>&quot;Monkey&quot;</strong> (Daniel), <strong>&quot;Spider&quot;</strong> (John), <strong>&quot;Fonzie&quot; </strong>(No idea).
</p>
<p>
My dad had friends named <strong>&quot;Twenty Bucks&quot;</strong> (Tony), <strong>&quot;Johnny Lawnmower&quot;</strong> (Johnny) and <strong>&quot;Voolie&quot;</strong> (No idea).
</p>
<p>
It's strange to be this old and realize that most people didn't grow up around these kinds of names. You have a lot of those realizations in college or when you move away from your home town, but I think it's fascinating I just had it now.
