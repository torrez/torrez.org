<p>So that book I linked to, <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2007/08/the-museum-of-j.html">"Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder"</a> turns out to have had its start in the New Yorker. Apparently it has that in common with <a href="http://emdashes.com/2007/08/that-appeared-in-the-new-yorke.php">a few works of fiction as well</a>. (I found the link on <a href="http://www.coudal.com/">Coudal</a> but was informed of the connection by <a href="http://snarkout.org/">Steve Cook</a>.)</p>
