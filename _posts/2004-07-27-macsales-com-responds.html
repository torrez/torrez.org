Larry from OWC responded to this post and we have exchanged emails. While I understand that Benjamin and Larry believe that some spammer happened to pluck that address (or guessed <script type="text/javascript">

</script> after not having ever guessed my other instant aliases), I think to immediately dismiss the possibility that someone culled some addresses from their database is unfair. Because email is broken does not mean their security isn't. How many reports has Benjamin ignored because he believes there is no chance their database has been compromised?

Two people brought up the fact that I was putting my macsales.com email address in the wild by posting it to my site. If you do a view-source you'll see that I encoded it using HiveWare's <a href="http://automaticlabs.com/products/enkoderform/">Enkoder Form</a>. No bot is reading my address off that page.

<p>
I'm not saying there isn't a chance the email address wasn't found in a log file somewhere along the line. I'm not even saying someone didn't hack into my Mac and find that address. I wrote OWC/MacSales.com because I had a problem, and all I got in return was spelling mistakes and assurances I was completely and absolutely wrong.
