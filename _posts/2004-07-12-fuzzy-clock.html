I found this nice menu bar app called a "<a href="http://www.objectpark.org/FuzzyClock.html">FuzzyClock</a>" on a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/word-clock-017495.php">Gizmodo post about WordClocks</a>.

I installed it, not expecting much, and found myself glancing at it more often than the built-in clock. There is something about words versus numbers that keeps my eye looking no further than "quarter to twelve".
