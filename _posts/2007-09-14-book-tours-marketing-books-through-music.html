<p><a href="http://blog.largeheartedboy.com/">Large Hearted Boy</a> has a feature on their site where authors of books <a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/book_notes/">list some of the music they were listening to when writing the book</a>, or just inspired them in some way. </p>

<p>The current author is <a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2007/09/book_notes_davi_6.html">David Rosen ("I Just Want My Pants Back")</a>.</p>

<p>Also, check out the rest of <a href="http://blog.largeheartedboy.com/">LHB</a>, the work they put into gathering links from across the web is commendable. If you ever find yourself with a couple of hours to spend, hit LHB, open all the shorties in tabs while you listen to the daily downloads.</p>
