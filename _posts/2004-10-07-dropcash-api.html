<p>
I have posted the beginnings of the <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/doc/api.php">Dropcash API</a> to Dropcash. So far I have the XML feed, the official Dropcash badge, and several plugins for TextPattern, ColdFusion, MovableType, and Gordon Luk's C# COM Object.

<p>
The actual API is coming, I am home sick today and thought I'd clear off a few
maintenance items that have been calling my name. Be sure and support those developers who have made plugins for you to use.
