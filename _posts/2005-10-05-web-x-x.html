<p>
A lot of buzzing going on with that phrase Web2.0. It's a fine phrase. It's like Ajax, easier to say than XMLHTTPRequest Object and it provides some context for a conversation. But like Ajax, it's the same story as before: people like to get excited about new things, even if those new things are just the same old things synthesized or standardized in a new way.
</p>
<p>
Whatever you want to call it, whatever you think it means, I know one thing: <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000193.html">the people who actually build stuff win this round</a>. I could not be happier for Andy, Leonard, and Gordon. The right people got the right reward for doing it the way it's supposed to be done.
</p>
<p>
When I lived in LA we used to meet up once a week for a &quot;geek dinner&quot; where we'd get a chance to talk about web topics, ideas for apps, or see what cool gadget Leonard just got from Asia that we wouldn't see in our stores for 5 years.
</p>
<p>
Andy's original idea for our &quot;geek dinners&quot; was based around the famous Pho mailing-list meetings that would happen in Berkeley. His work on Upcoming back then, I think, was prompted by the idea of our dinnners, and how others would want to meet up in a similar way. We always had a problem choosing where to eat, and we'd invariably end up at the noodle place followed by boba.
</p>
<p>
While Upcoming evolved into something almost entirely different, it's a clear example of how things should work. You need something. You build it for yourself, you build it for others. You share it, refine it, and get rewarded for it.
</p>
<p>
That's every version of Web in my book.
