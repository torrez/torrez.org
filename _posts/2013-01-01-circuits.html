<p>For Christmas I put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AHQWS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002AHQWS">Snap Circuits</a> on my wish list so that my son and I could start putting together circuits. He doesn't get most of it, but the little bits he does get (what certain components do, how things change when you disconnect certain wires) is enough for us to talk about things we want to build.</p>

<p>This past weekend was the first time he began reading and comprehending sentences. It sort of just happened. First he recognized the name of a cat in a book, and then the dog’s name, and then he learned “and” and various “oh”s and “go”s, and after that it just quickly built on itself. Watching this unfold over the span of an hour was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life.</p>
