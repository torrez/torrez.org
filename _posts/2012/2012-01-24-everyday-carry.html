<p>I’ve become fond of a weblog called <a href="http://everyday-carry.com/">Everyday Carry</a>. When I decided to dust off my newsreader I asked some friends for their OPMLs so I could see what they were reading and Everyday Carry was one that came in a bundle of consumer-centric feeds <a href="http://adammathes.com/">Adam Mathes</a> read for <a href="http://decommodify.com/">Decommodify</a>.</p>

<p>The basic idea is people send in photos of what they carry every day, with a little summary of what the items are and possibly a little backstory on how they acquired the item. The goal seems to be minimalism crossed with preparedness, and so there is a theme amongst the enthusiasts that I’ve been able to observe. Most carry a light, a bit of rope, a hook of some sort, a small number of keys (usually one), a knife, a wallet, and a watch. </p>

<p>Each post has a followup by the editor thanking them for the contribution and praising or offering a gentle suggestion about how they could achieve a more efficient everyday carry. </p>

<p>There are no Amazon encoded links to buy your own, that feels noteworthy.</p>

<p>Some time ago I decided I would not carry a bag and laptop into work. I keep my work iMac at the office and commute with only my keys, a wallet, and iPhone (with standard earbuds). My keys have an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YH5V9O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000YH5V9O">Inka Pen keychain</a> that has saved me more times than I can count.</p>

<p>I don’t imagine I would ever submit to Everyday Carry, but the site is a bright spot as I read through my feeds.</p>
