<p><a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/52a20d7a17de">Matt posted about Facebook vs. Twitter on Medium</a>. We were talking the other day about this and I said something that occurred to me during our conversation. Facebook vs. Twitter is essentially real names vs user names. And it makes sense that most of my friends from the old days of the web, when user names were king, have gravitated to Twitter. While all the people we were getting away from have taken to Facebook.</p>

<p>I did create a Facebook account many years ago, but deleted it. Then when MLKSHK was starting up I created another so I could make a MLKSHK page, but Facebook itself has never, ever been interesting to me.</p>

<p>After I left FM I had lunch with a Facebook co-founder. We could not be more in disagreement about real identity versus fake names. I left that conversation feeling like perhaps I had it all wrong and I should give in to the world of real names, but Twitter has validated my feelings about what some people want, and I love that.</p>
