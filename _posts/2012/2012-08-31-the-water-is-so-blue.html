<p>I link to <a href="https://twitter.com/LoraKrulak/statuses/238364096326668288">this tweet and photo</a> not to make fun of her, but only to point out the absurdity of filters. I do hope she had the option set that saves the original version of her photo. That would have made for a great picture with no filter at all.</p>
