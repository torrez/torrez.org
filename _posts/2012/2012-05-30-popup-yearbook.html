<p>Totally random idea I’ve been chewing on for, oh, 8 years?</p>

<p>Popup Yearbook. Page gets created. Everyone in a certain group is invited to upload one picture of themselves from the year. The page is locked after a period of time.</p>

<p>Stupid simple idea but a community site I manage does this every year and it’s a lot of fun to see the finished result.</p>
