<p>Do you remember <a href="http://airtime.com/">Airtime</a>? I like to think of it as the thing <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/sean-parkers-airtime-launch-olivia-munn-joel-mchale_n_1571336.html">Olivia Munn, Joel McHale, and Jim Carrey</a> use daily. These days Airtime is still <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/14/airtime-video-posts/">working out their business</a> but here’s an idea about how I would like an Airtime-like service to work. </p>

<p>I would like to be able to look at a directory of stuff. Things. A live-view of Niagra Falls. An original Star Wars movie poster. A 1976 Gibson Bicentennial Thunderbird. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_U.S._veterans_of_World_War_II">living WWII Veteran</a>. A demo of an <a href="http://www.teenageengineering.com/products/op-1">OP-1</a>. </p>

<p>Hell, I’d even love to connect to a Best Buy representative who could demonstrate the latests TiVos.</p>

<p>All these people or owners of these things could register with the site specifically for these things. I could call up the 1976 Gibson owner and have a look at it. Not necessarily to buy anything, though that would be nice, but just to chat about or get a review.</p>

<p>Currently Airtime let’s you designate interests (cooking), but beyond interests I would like to find experts or informed owners of gadgets and collectibles who have put themselves on the service because they want to take calls and talk about a life experience (WWII) or fanatic interest.</p>
