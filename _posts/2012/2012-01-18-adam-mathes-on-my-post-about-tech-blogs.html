<p><a href="http://trenchant.org/daily/2012/1/18/">Adam really said it better</a> than <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2012/01/backdoor-deals.html">I was able to say it</a>. He even uses a word that was on the tip of my tongue but I could not find: “spectacle”. Here’s a portion of his post:</p>

<blockquote>
The implicit, underlying assumption of much of journalism is that reality isn’t interesting enough, or comprehensible enough on its own. It needs to be reinterpreted through storytelling with a bias towards conflict, personality, stereotype, conventional wisdom and other tropes that make what is boring and unfamiliar to the writer more palatable to a large audience.
</blockquote>

<p>YES. That.</p>
