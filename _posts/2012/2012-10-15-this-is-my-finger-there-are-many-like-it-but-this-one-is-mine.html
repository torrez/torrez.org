title: This Is My Finger. There Are Many Like It, But This One Is Mine

<p>When Apple <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/apple-to-acquire-authentec-for-356-million/">bought the biometric security company Authentec</a> I decided to buy one of their USB fingerprint readers to see what Apple saw in them and maybe learn a little bit about some tech that might be showing up in future Apple products. </p>

<p>In the time I bought it to when it was delivered to me they stopped selling them on the site. Also, the store and developer site were taken down so I wasn’t able to write any of my own software to use it, and even if I could, nobody could buy a device of their own. But I could still install the tools that integrated with OS X’s security system and that was still interesting to me.</p>

<p>Since I rarely take my laptop out of the house, it’s not too big a deal to have this nub of plastic hanging off the side. Plus I wanted to see what it’d be like to use my fingerprint to unlock and perform administration functions.</p>

<p>Sliding your finger along the scanner takes some time to get right. Even after using it for a few weeks I still only get about a 75% hit rate, but it can still be quicker than typing my ten character password.</p>

<p>In the past month as discussions about password security and authentication crop up, I keep thinking about how great it feels to not even think about a password when using the device.</p>

<p>I use 1Password for 99% of all my passwords and while I still would recommend using it, I can now see a future when 1Password is no longer needed.</p>
