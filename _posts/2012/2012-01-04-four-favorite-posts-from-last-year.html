<p>I had this sitting in <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> as a draft for longer than I meant to. Last year I created a bookmark folder called Best of 2011 and throughout the year dragged a link in there to every post that knocked it out of the park. I edited the list down a bit after re-reading them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://caterina.net/?s=fomo+social">FOMO and Social Media</a> by Caterina Fake. <em>(This is not the correct URL for the piece, but her site is in transition and the URLs are a bit broken.)</em> I noticed a lot of the posts in the folder were those wake-up call posts that sort of jar you back into reality. I have known of Caterina for years, of course, but we had never met until this year and I am really glad I got a chance to. This post arrived at a time when we were creating MLKSHK and I think it altered its direction a little bit. It certainly altered my perceptions a bit.</li>
<li><a href="http://adrianshort.co.uk/2011/09/25/its-the-end-of-the-web-as-we-know-it/">It’s the End of the Web As We Know It</a> by Adrian Short. The title of this post is over the top but such is the state of the web right now. Inside the post there is an important point about where we are sliding as we give Facebook and Twitter our identities. I have more to say on this subject. It angers me when I see people only allow a Facebook option for creating accounts on sites that have very little to do with the Facebook service. I hope to write that post soon.</li>
<li><a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction</a> by Bret Victor. This is the web I want. You don’t just read this post, you use this post. What an amazing piece of work this is. See also: <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design</a> for another good post from Mr. Victor.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html">The Web Is a Customer Service Medium</a> by Paul Ford. A lot of people put this on their lists of great posts last year and it deserves it. I just read it again and I want to push a Like button or fill in a little red heart or drop a nickel in a Paul Ford hat. I suppose I will do what we used to do in the old days: link it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, not posted this year, but I saw it this year. I will leave you with the Venn diagram (hah! seriously!) that influences my work life right now: <a href="http://whatconsumesme.com/2009/posts-ive-written/how-to-be-happy-in-business-venn-diagram/">How To Be Happy In Business</a>.</p>
