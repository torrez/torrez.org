<p>I forget how nice it is to write something, see someone get inspired by a bit of it and run with it. Weblogs are still the best place to unpack and share ideas.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uncluttah.com/blog/2012/07/24/unfollowing/">Matthew Crist</a> took my <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2012/07/we-met-on-the-internet.html">post about following and attention</a> and built <a href="http://unfollowing.net/">unfollowing.net</a>.</p>

<p>It is currently offline due (I suspect) to Twitter’s rules about automating certain actions on behalf of users. I know there are a myriad of good reasons why they do this, but hopefully they can work something out where users can easily choose to reboot their list of who they are following. I think it’s a nice way to get out from underneath what some might feel is a burden and get back to what they love about Twitter.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t want to unfollow everyone. I cited Paul Ford’s example to point out he figured out what he needed to do and it worked for him. Others have let me know they also unfollowed a lot of people and I think that’s pretty cool. They’re doing it because they still care about it. I think that’s why this subject strikes a chord with others. Nothing can replace it, they just want to lower the burden and distraction.</p>
