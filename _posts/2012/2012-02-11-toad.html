<p><em>
<strong>I have an important question. Nintendo has also just released Mariokart 7 for the 3DS. In every iteration of Mariokart, I’ve always preferred to play as Toad. Who’s your favorite character?</strong></p>

<p>That’s the most challenging question! I’m sorry that I cannot come up with an interesting answer. Somehow, it’s habit to me, but I play with Mario. He’s a very balanced character.</p>

<p><strong>Who’s your least favorite character?</strong></p>

<p>Toad. [Laughs]</p>

<p><strong>My favorite character is your least favorite character?</strong></p>

<p>I understand that he has some popularity. Somehow.

<p>Our household loves Toad! Somehow.</p>
