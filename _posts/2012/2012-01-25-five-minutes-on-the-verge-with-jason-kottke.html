<p>An <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/25/2721249/5-minutes-on-the-verge-jason-kottke">interview with Jason Kottke</a> on The Verge. Jason’s blog is still, consistently, the blog to read. Even more so now that he’s able to draw from <a href="http://stellar.io">Stellar</a>.</p>

<p>I have two invitations to Stellar to hand out. Just ask: <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=webclient&amp;text=%40torrez+stellar+invitation%3F">@torrez</a>.</p>
