<p>I’m a quitter. I quit using <a href="http://vicoapp.com/">Vico</a> the text editor for Mac that replicates many of Vim’s features in a Mac-like UI. (<a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2011/11/">Earlier post on the subject</a>)</p>

<p>I had a big day of coding last week and found myself flipping to <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> to deal with a tricky multi-line selection. I was surprised to find out in the few months since I’d left Sublime Text it had received a multitude of updates and fixes. The tabs work and look better. It became difficult to switch back to Vico that day, and a this Monday when I needed to write a lot of code I went straight for Sublime Text.</p>

<p>Vico was very good and I was certainly faster. I could write code faster when I wasn’t having to learn a new keyboard command. And that was basically the problem, I got sick of learning. Yeah, I have to reach over and use the touchpad every few minutes while editing, but since I do that already in this (MarsEdit) and Google documents and any other edit window that is not Vico it seemed strange to have to switch my mind to vim editing.</p>
