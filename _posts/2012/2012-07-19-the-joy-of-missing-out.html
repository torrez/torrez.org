<p>To continue a theme here, my friend Anil just <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2012/07/jomo.html">wrote about the Joy of Missing Out</a> (JOMO).</p>

<p>People have asked me if I am going to unfollow everyone or simply quit Twitter and I’ve been replying that I don’t think that is a solution. I enjoy Twitter more than any other site (probably more than MLKSHK?) and so unfollowing would remove something that I do enjoy.</p>

<p>I cited Paul Ford unfollowing people because he figured out what he needed to do, but that’s not my answer.</p>

<p>I think Anil nailed it. I have to learn to enjoy missing out by not thinking about it as “missing out”. Consciously deciding not to check in because there are other things I want to do with my time is what I have been doing the last couple of nights.</p>

<p>So far it is working pretty well.</p>
