<p>A year ago today my awesome wife started her contractions early in the morning and by MIDNIGHT we were holding <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/torrez/3042523804/">our little boy</a>. Today Mark is one year old.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/torrez/4050891048/" title="My Little Boy Is 1 Year Old Today by torrez, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2564/4050891048_5737ec342a.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="My Little Boy Is 1 Year Old Today" /></a></p>

<p>There really are no words to describe how important my family is to me or how much Mark has completely changed everything in my life. It was surprising (but not unexpected) to see this crazed, instinctual dad show up  on day one. </p>

<p>What was not expected was that I discovered this incredible feeling of admiration for my own parents. Somewhere after college (when loans were paid off) I think I took for granted all the hard work they put into raising us. I'm tearing up just writing this now. What a wonderful thing.</p>
