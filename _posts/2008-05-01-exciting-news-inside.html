<p>Since I don't explicitly write much biographical posts, I figure once in a while won't be too bothersome. I think the last time I updated my site that way it was the night before Amber and I were married. Since then we've been to Fiji [best vacation ever] and then got down to baby conceiving [<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/2417267264/">success</a>!].</p>

<p>Another life-changing event happened just yesterday: we bought a car. We'd been carless for over a year. While I LOVE taking public transportation and walking a mile to catch a train to take me two miles to catch a bus to take me five miles into work every day, I'd prefer that my future son or daughter did not have to admit to friends twenty years from now that they had been born in the back of a taxi.</p>

<p>So now we have this car and wellâ€¦I LOVE IT ZOMG!!!1! I think the thing that will change the most is that I can stay up a little later and sleep in a little later. It means my day isn't ruled by the bus schedule out of Sausalito and I can pick up all the crackers and yogurt my wife needs. </p>

<p>Also: bitchin' stereo.</p>
