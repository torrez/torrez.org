<p>Here’s your yearly reminder that Fez is landing on the XBox soon. If you know what Fez is, you’ve probably already jumped to the next blog post by now. But if you don’t know, the developers have put together a page <a href="http://polytroncorporation.com/what-is-fez">explaining what Fez is</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
There are no enemies in FEZ. No bosses, no combat. In fact, no conflict of any kind. You can die, but there is no penalty for doing so. FEZ aims to create a non-threatening world rich with ambiance, a pleasant place to spend time in.

<p>Fez is also prominently featured in “Indie Game: The Movie”:</p>
