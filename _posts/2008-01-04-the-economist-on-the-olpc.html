<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/daily/columns/techview/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10472304&amp;fsrc=nwl">The Economist on the OLPC</a>: "This leads to the final problem that has done the most to disappoint OLPC&rsquo;s fans: the hubris, arrogance and occasional self-righteousness of OLPC workers. They treated all criticism as enemy fire to be deflected and quashed rather than considered and possibly taken on board." twittered by <a href="http://www.consolationchamps.com/">James</a></p>
