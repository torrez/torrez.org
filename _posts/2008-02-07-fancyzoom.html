<p>Cabel has finally <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html">packaged up his FancyZoom project</a> so regular folks can have those fancy Javascript image zooms on their site. He has examples at the end  of the post to show you how it works. If you're a regular reader of his site you have undoubtedly been jealous of them.</p>
