<p>For being small, San Francisco has a lot of neighborhoods in its 7x7 miles. When I talked about moving to the <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2008/05/san-francisco-n.html">Outer Sunset</a> yesterday I forgot to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_District%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California">link the Wikipedia page</a> for the neighborhood.</p>

<p>And, to be accurate, we're actually going to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkside%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California">Parkside</a>.</p>
