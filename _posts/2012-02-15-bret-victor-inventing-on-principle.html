<p>If you haven’t seen this talk yet, I wanted to make sure you did. One thing though: as you watch it remember it is <em>not</em> about a text editor or a new way to write code. There is a much larger statement being made so don’t get caught up in the “ain’t that cool” factor. </p>

<p>I wasn’t sure if I should post this on our Simpleform blog or here. I have this blog post coming about my new life as a small business owner and how differently I carry myself these days. The work is similar, but different. We still ship code, solve problems, and have a good time, but there is much more concern about planning and our future than there was with MLKSHK.</p>

<p>This talk arrived at a very good time.</p>
