<p><a href="http://www.needsforsale.com/">Needs For Sale</a> is an idea that came out of a project called <a href="http://www.wantsforsale.com/">Wants For Sale</a>. The "needs" idea is that they paint a picture of an item and set the price as the actual price of the item painted. When you buy it, they use the money to buy the actual object and donate it to someone. found on <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/">coolhunting</a>.</p>
