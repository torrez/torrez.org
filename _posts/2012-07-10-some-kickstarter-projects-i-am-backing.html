title: Some Kickstarter Projects I Am Backing
category: Projects
---
<p>I don’t know what happened this week but suddenly I am really into Kickstarter. I’ve supported a few things in the past, but never really got into it until now.</p>

<p>I discovered I could not be followed on Kickstarter because they rely on Facebook accounts, so I thought I’d list my recently backed projects here for fun. (<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/torrez">kickstarter.com/profile/torrez</a>)</p>

<p>Jack Cheng’s book <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jackcheng/these-days-a-novel">“These Days”</a> sounds so good to me. For some reason backing books is an easy decision. I love books and I love the story of self-publishing. So whether it’s fiction or a book someone thinks needs to be written I want to help them. Plus when I was a kid I wanted to design computer interfaces for movies.</p>

<p>“<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glennf/crowdfunding-a-guide-to-what-works-and-why">Crowdfunding: a Guide to What Works and Why</a>”. Glenn Fleishman’s writing a book about crowd funding. Duh.</p>

<p>“<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thingm/blink1-the-usb-rgb-led">blink(1), the USB RGB LED</a>” Simple. Obvious. Affordable little project I can hack with. It’s so obvious yet nobody I know of has done this. I love it. I can’t wait.</p>

<p>“<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1272178253/celebrated-summer-book-one-300-copy-print-run">Celebrated Summer</a>” is a book by Chris Ernest Hall. Here is his bio: <em>“Chris Ernest Hall has written a lot, but never been published. He’s worked on a lot of failed software products. He lives with his mother and three cats. THE END.”</em> Straight off the cover and title are a tribute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Day_Rising">Hüsker Dü</a>, so if I was browsing in a book store this would already be in my stack for buying. But something about that synopsis (and bio)…I can’t put my finger on it. But I want to read this EXACTLY as much as I want to help Chris publish it.</p>
