title: Don't Punish Everyone
category: Work

<p>Two recent posts about punishing a large group over one person (or company's) actions:</p>

<p>First Derek Siver's post titled "<a href="http://sivers.org/punish">Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person's mistake</a>".</p>

<p>Next John Scalzi's <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/02/01/all-the-many-ways-amazon-so-very-failed-the-weekend/">post about Amazon's actions</a> this past weekend regarding <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvWlhq4nwrhQWDFQcYaOe5-Xl7tQ">the Macmillan pricing disagreement</a>. Don't let the unfortunate use of the word "fail" here discourage you from reading it.</p>
