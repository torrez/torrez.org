<p>I'd heard a bit about this but wasn't sure if it was going to be something like a "Jackass Guide To Finding Good Drugs In Liberia". Last night I saw <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/vbs/">CNN is running a special where they present some of the stories</a>, so I figured it must be worth looking into and it was. I was only going to watch a couple of parts before I went to bed and ended up watching the whole thing. </p>

<p>I should warn you, it is extremely graphic and sad.</p>
