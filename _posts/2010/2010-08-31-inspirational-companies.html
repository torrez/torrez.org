<p>While having lunch today with <a href="http://twitter.com/rodbegbie">rodbegbie</a> we talked a bit about companies we like that we pay to use and are happy to pay to use. I can think of four right off the bat, but I'd love to hear if you have any you particularly like.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/">Github</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rdio.com/">Rdio</a></li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These companies are of course a huge influence on my thinking in <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2010/08/workin-9-to-5.html">this post</a> about Simpleform and mlkshk, and absolutely what I am trying to emulate.</p>

<p>@ me on Twitter, I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/?status=@torrez">torrez</a>.</p>

<p>Update: Some nice companies sent in via Twitter:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.weendure.com/">We Endure</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.giganews.com/">GigaNews</a></li>
</ul>
