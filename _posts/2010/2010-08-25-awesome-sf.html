<p>There's a project in San Francisco called <a href="http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-08-25/news/awesome-project-offers-1-000-grants-for-quirky-ideas/">The Awesome Project</a> (link to news article) that is actually a pretty good ideaâ€”but, San Francisco being San Francisco there is the inevitable project that is creating "audio tours for ferry rides across the San Francisco Bay that address the consequences of rising sea levels." Christ. Or done to death "displays pictures of the sky taken every 10 seconds for a year from a camera atop the Exploratorium." </p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://twitter.com/awesomesfo">Twitter account here</a>. <a href="http://awesomefoundation.org/">Web site here</a>. Let's hope there are more "string zip-lines from the Transamerica Pyramid" and less "paint a flower for every prarie dog that will die today."</p>

<p>UPDATE: I just re-read this and I don't know why I'm so grumpy about these ideas. Idea people really should just use <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> though.</p>
