<p>I'm not even going to ask to borrow $3.95 million dollars. Things would be weird between us, and you'd probably get all jerky at Christmas like, "Oh, I see you could buy everyone a KindleDX but couldn't swing the $98,750 you owe me this month on the loan! I'm Just Saying!"</p>

<p>So anyway, <a href="http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2010/01/04/richard_neutradesigned_duplex_in_the_marina_for_395_mil.php">this home designed by Richard Neutra is for sale</a> for $3.95 million. Which is a STEAL if you are the sort of person who buys things for 3.95 million dollars. </p>

<p>Either the person who staged it or the previous owner (who spent 10 years restoring it) made some mistakes, I think you can spend the .05 million you're saving on this place and get some new lights and kitchen appliances. </p>
