<p>That <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2009/12/resolutions-2010.html">only music from 2010 project</a> I mentioned? I'm keeping a weblog here: <a href="http://radio.torrez.org/">radio.torrez.org</a>. </p>

<p>Right now I'm going through the 09's looking for stuff I missed. There's no way I can go without music for a month, so January 2010 I'm allowing myself to catch up to last year's music.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I'll have a go at reviews&#8212;but reviews are like, just my opinion, man.</p>
