<p>I'm giving Apple's new product Ping a try. For no reason other than I hope they do implement these things, here is a few stuff I wish it would do. </p>

<ul>
<li>Keep track of every song I listen to and post it someplace with charts and shit. I still have to use Last.fm.</li>
<li>An open REST API so I can pull that data or permit other applications to pull that data.</li>
<li>Treat my collection as one group, not of stuff I bought from iTunes and stuff I didn't buy from iTunes.</li>
<li>I don't want to like someone's like.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, you can <a href="http://c.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZConnections.woa/wa/viewProfile?userId=16333640">follow me here</a>.</p>
