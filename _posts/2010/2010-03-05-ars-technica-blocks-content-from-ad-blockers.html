category: Web/Tech

<p>Ars Technica is now blocking their content from people blocking their ads. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents.ars?comments=1#comments-bar">The comments in this thread are priceless</a>. People are threatening to never read Ars again because they can't get the content without ads. Imagine that!</p>

<p>The alternative is to actually sign up for a subscription and all ads would disappear. <strike>I think I might just sign up.</strike> I did sign up.</p>
