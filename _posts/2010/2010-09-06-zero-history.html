<p>William Gibson's latest book "Zero History" is being released tomorrow. In anticipation I've been reading through the previous two novels in the trilogy. And once again I'm looking at the <a href="http://www.historypreservation.com/hpassociates/buzzrlanding_2.php">Buzz Rickson flight jackets</a>. If San Francisco ever got cold enough to wear these I'd probably buy one today.</p>
