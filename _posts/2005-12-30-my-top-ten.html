<em>My</em> best of 2005 doesn't really stick to any one medium. I tried listing my favorite music this year,
but some of it was recorded in 1993. I tried listing some favorite movies, but I couldn't think of anything
I got on Netflix this year that wasn't a TV show or made in some year like 1993. So then I thought about books
and there was just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840880/nutshell-20">the one</a> I thought was worth
reading.
</p>
<p>
So here are my favorite things of 2005. In no particular order.
</p>
<h3>Fisher Space Pen</h3>
<p>
	I just bought my second and third
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001FF9F0/nutshell-20">Fisher Space Pen</a>.
	I accidentally left my first one in the car I dropped off at Hertz so I bought two more.
	I like to find something that works and stick with it, and right now it's these wonderful pens.
	Sure they write through blood and water, and you can write upside down, but the secret to why it's so
	great is that when closed it's about 3/4<sup>ths</sup> the size of a normal pen,
	when you take the cap off and place it at the end of the pen the size grows to a normal size pen. Add
	in the very simple, black matte, metal, &quot;bullet&quot; design and a ball point that seems to begin delivering
	ink a micrometer before it touches the paper, and you have the best and only pen you'll ever need. (Unless
	you are all about precision, in which case I have to recommend my previous favorite pen, the <a href="http://www.gellyroll.com/products/pens/microperm/microperm.html">Sakura
		Microperm</a>).
</p>
<h3>Camper Shoes</h3>
<p>
	This year I went all out on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000BM7LMW/nutshell-20">Camper Shoes</a>.
	I now have seven pair. Moving to San Francisco has meant I'm on my feet more,
	and some of the shoes (not all) do very well for walking. Now that the Camper stores are popping up in
	the larger US cities, they aren't as rare, so they don't make me feel nearly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gregveen/64312919/">as
		unique as they did</a> when I'd be <a href="http://www.i18nguy.com/l10n/shoes.html">on this page</a> hoping I
		wasn't ordering a shoe that would fit on a keychain.
</p>
<h3>The Mountain Goats - &quot;The Sunset Tree&quot;</h3>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.honan.net/">Mat</a> got me into the Mountain Goats this year. It's an album. A real full album
	like the old days when you'd drop the needle on the record and sit in your room and follow along (not that I really ever
	did this but I'm told by old people with Who albums that they did). It feels
	like sharing any song from the album is like sharing a chapter from a book out of context, but before I heard
	the album Mat had given me <a href="http://www.torrez.org/mp3s/The%20Mountain%20Goats%20-%20Dance%20Music.mp3">this recording</a>
	the MGs had done on the John Peel show which got me interested.
</p>
<p>
	John Darnielle also has my favorite thing said this year, <a href="http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=6405">from this interview</a>
	done in haiku:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
	Q. Preparing yourself<br />
	for an ominous ending<br />
	What is the magpie?</p>

<p>
	A. Only a traitor<br />
	undresses his metaphors<br />
	As if they were whores</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Graph Paper</h3>
<p>
	Hell yeah I said graph paper. I love graph paper. I'm going to buy stacks of it. I like to use the 8 squares to the inch
	though that 16 square looks HOT. When was the last time <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006VRR68/nutshell-20">you used graph paper</a>?
</p>

<h3>iTunes TV Shows</h3>
<p>
	I totally missed the boat on the TV show &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JNOG/nutshell-20">Lost</a>&quot; due to work and moving. I hate jumping into something mid-season
	and so I figured I'd wait until it showed up on Netflix. For the holidays I was able to catch up using the iTunes
	Music store and that rules more than graph paper. I work a lot more on my laptop than I did at my old job. The fact that I can call up a TV show for $1.99 is pure joy. Though I have to wonder, why does
	99Â¢ seem like a bit much for a song I could conceivably listen to 100 times, and $1.99 about right for a TV show I'd watch
	once? I can't figure that one out.
</p>

<h3>San Francisco</h3>
<p>
	This town is swell. We love it here. The weather isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be, we're still in
	California after all, so Christmas Eve, when I was getting ready to drive down to my parents house it was
	clear and sunny, and I didn't need a coat. I dunno why everyone is all crazed about this weather, I've
	seen bad weather and this isn't it. I love being able to walk and get a beer, or coffee, or ride the train
	to downtown without worrying about parking. I do hate that
	I don't have easy access to stores like Target and Home Depot, though. Back in Long Beach it was easy
	to get to those stores if you had a lot of stuff to buy, now you have to plan a bit more. Plus I don't have
	my truck so you have to get creative with getting large things into the house.
</p>
<p>
	To say it's a bit segregated would be an understatement. There are things about this neighborhood (Noe Valley)
	that annoy me and I think I'd like to be closer to the Mission if I could, but overall I like San Francisco
	and it beat out Italy when I made this list so that's pretty good.
</p>

<h3>Quicksilver</h3>
<p>
	Along with <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>
	is an application for Macintosh that I use religiously. I find it better and more agile than Tiger's Spotlight,
	and the plugins made for it are pretty varied.
	If you have a Mac you should try it out. Then check out Merlin's post on using its <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/21/qs-redux/">append to text file</a> feature
	for your todo lists.
</p>

<h3>HipsterPDA</h3>
<p>
	Speaking of Merlin, you should really meet Merlin. He's an interesting guy with great ideas and great hair. Seriously.

</p>
<p>
	Anyway, Merlin &quot;invented&quot; the <a href="http://www.hipsterpda.com/">HipsterPDA</a> and it's become my favorite
	organizational tool behind my .Mac residing todo.txt file. I've owned several palm organizers and learned how to chicken
	scratch letters on them only to have them trickle down to the bottom of my pile of crap I have no use for. Also, it's cheap!
</p>


<h3>Products</h3>

<p>
	Like I said in my Fisher Pen item above, when I find something that works well I stick with it. And this
	year was all about three products: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C8XKY/nutshell-20">Tom's of Maine</a>
	Toothpaste, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00012NDTW/nutshell-20">Dr. Bronner's Soap</a>, and an array of
	<a href="http://www.kiehls.com/_us/_en/home/index.aspx">Kiehl's</a>&nbsp; products.
</p>
<p>
	When I was a kid I remember toothpaste being toothpaste and not candy. It seems like toothpaste now is so sweet
	and candied that I don't feel like I'm getting my teeth clean so much as coating my mouth with stuff that smells
	good. It's like air freshner for the mouth when I really need to be cleaning it.
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C8XKY/nutshell-20">Tom's of Maine</a> just works. And it's
	in a simple tube that doesn't make me feel like I'm not only buying toothpaste but funding some toothpaste
	manufacturer's R&amp;D budget to make some crazy dispenser.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00012NDTW/nutshell-20">Dr. Bronner's Soap</a> isn't a very new
	product, it's apparently been around a while and I've seen it in people's bathrooms and heard about it from friends
	but didn't really come around to using the soap until this year. It comes in a
	<a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_386.html">bottle straight out of crazy world</a> and being
	a sucker for packaging I bought a couple bottles when I saw them at Trader Joe's. Of the three companies
	I'm talking about, Dr. Bronner's wasn't featured in any Seth Godin book I know of, but it should. It's the purple
	cow to end all purple cows, and it's damn good soap.
</p>
<p>
	I am a sucker for good marketing and good packaging. When I first saw a Kiehl's store I knew I was going to buy
	a cartload of stuff. The fact that I think the products (specifically the shaving cream, non-alcohol toner, and
	shampoo) work so well is why I keep buying it. Only later did I find out it was a Lancome company with a trumped
	up back story. Being a fan of Seth Godin's books means that sometimes you either feel like a total hypocrite or
	just an informed shopper when you fall for stuff like Kiehl's. It is good though.
</p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>

<p>
	A few things that were good but not great last year:
</p>
	<ol>
			<li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007TFLLC/nutshell-20">PSP</a> and
				<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FSLC/nutshell-20">Wipeout Pure</a> for
				my trip to Italy. Sitting on the train or waiting out jetlag in the hotel went by quickly
				with this game. I still can't hear the music and not think of Rome or Venice.</li>
			<li>Any game I was insanely excited about after E3. Nothing really kept me playing this year. All the
				GTA:III styled
				games turned out to be the yellow-fade of the gaming world. &quot;Ooh, I get to drive a motorcycle around and
				run over people. That's a game?&quot;
				Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007PIEAQ/nutshell-20">Psychonauts</a> became
				tedious and grating after a few hours. I did nearly finish <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0009I6S0O/nutshell-20">Shadow of the Colossus</a> but
				it was during a time when I was swamped at work and couldn't really devote my evenings to it. I'll probably
				finish it up in the next month.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> is a great service, but it feels like they hit a brick wall in terms of building their application.
				It's the same service it was (to me) as it was a year ago. They added some friend features and cleaned
				up the interface a bit, but nothing that really made me feel like they were devoting much time to its future.
				Where are the video games? Where are the PSP movies? Netflix is rapidly becoming the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdnow">CDNOW</a> of online rentals.</li>
	</ol>

<h3>Stuff That Didn't</h3>
<p>
	There were a few things I had been excited about this year that turned out to not be what I had hoped for. While
	PHP turned 10 years old, Ruby on Rails (or, as I lovingly refer to it: Ruby on Rims) went 1.0. I know, Ruby on Rails runs
	best on LightTPD, PHP runs best on nearly everything. I think Ruby as a language is wonderfully simple and a good
	language to be introduced to programming on, I think I just didn't mesh with the RoR way. I can't wait to do an app
	with it, I just didn't trust it when I first tried. It really isn't you, Ruby, it's me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gamefly.com/">Gamefly</a> was a <strong>huge</strong> disappointment. Their turn around times are atrocious and it's like their interface people have never used Netflix before. When I first signed up it took nearly 2 weeks to get my first games, and my original calculation of $50 a month for one game vs. $30 for unlimited games seemed to be thrown off. Waiting a week or so to see a new game in the mail is hardly what I expected. <br />
</p>
<p>
	Not to sound like some tech-pundit blowhard but what is <a href="http://mpt.net.nz/archive/2005/12/30/gates">Microsoft</a> doing?
	They're almost completely off my radar now that I and nearly all my friends work on Macs. I realize that's dangerous, but come on, isometric views of my apartment? Big whoop.<br />
