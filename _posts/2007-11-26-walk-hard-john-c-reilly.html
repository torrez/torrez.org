<p>So bummed "<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/walkhard/medium.html">Walk Hard</a>" was brought to us by "the guy who brought you Talladega Nights". I just bought the first season of "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=267725195&amp;s=143441">Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job</a>" on iTunes and was reminded of how good John C. Reilly is. </p>

<p>Note: if you listen to <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">The Sound of Young America</a> you'll notice a correlation between stuff I watch/buy/talk about and stuff on that show. I just thought I'd point that out before you realized it.</p>
