<p>
I've had friends get married since I was in my teens. I'm realizing now, at age 33 I have very different reactions to my friends getting married.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I was in my 20's:</strong> "OMG, they're getting married this weekend in Vegas? HAha, that's so funny. They are crazy and spontaneous!"
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I was in my late 20's:</strong> "So weird, they were meant for each other though. I wonder if he's still going to be coming to beer and pool night..."
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I was in my early 30's:</strong> "Wow, everyone is suddenly getting married! How weird. I've been to like 3 weddings since Friday."
</p>
<p>
<strong>Now I'm in my mid 30's:</strong> "They're just getting married because they want new stuff or she's pregnant. Fuck, that's it for beer and pool night."
</p>
<p>
(Not that this applies to anyone currently planning to get married. I just realized my reaction has changed. Please don't un-invite me. I bought you salad tongs.)
