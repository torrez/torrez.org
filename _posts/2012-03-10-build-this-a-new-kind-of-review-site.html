<p>Last night I wanted to watch a movie so I went to iTunes and started sorting by stars when I realized something: I don’t generally like the most popular films in theaters, so why am I using everyone else’s star ratings to find good movies?</p>

<p>What does a four out of five star ranking actually <strong>mean</strong>?</p>

<p>Then I remembered an old idea I kicked around a bit before MLKSHK that I hope someone will someday make.</p>

<p>I originally registered the name dropsort.com which describes how I think it would work on the front-end.</p>

<p>The one sentence way to describe it is this: Drag and drop movies* to order them from left to right, ranking them as good to bad. The data generated from these, what I call “taste fingerprints”, would be used to help find other movies that people have ranked above identical taste fingerprints of others.</p>

<p>That is, if I ranked some heist movies like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef016763a34d16970b-pi" alt="Me" title="me.png" border="0" width="600" height="192" /></p>

<p>And you ranked some heist movies like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef016763a34d20970b-pi" alt="You" title="you.png" border="0" width="600" height="192" /></p>

<p>The service would possibly suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008OE4W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00008OE4W">Sneakers</a> as a movie you might enjoy because we ranked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008ENHTY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0008ENHTY">The Getaway</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KX0ISG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000KX0ISG">Reservoir Dogs</a> the same. (I say possibly because it should rely on a larger set of data, not just my single ranking.) </p>

<p>The assumption here is if people rank movies in a certain order relative to each other as <em>you</em> rank the same movies in a similar order, then there is a likelihood you might enjoy a movie they ranked higher than that match.</p>

<p>You could do this with genres, but also arbitrary categories like Woody Allen films or films shot in a certain location. As long as someone creates a set and enough people contribute rankings there would be enough data to make guesses for you.</p>

<p>I will build this someday if you don‘t.</p>
