<p>A few days ago I had a couple of ideas in the shower:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>A conference call system that dials its participants. A bank that issues reward points based on how much you save. It was a long shower.</p>&mdash; Andre Torrez (@torrez) <a href="https://twitter.com/torrez/status/184683262298427392" data-datetime="2012-03-27T16:48:15+00:00">March 27, 2012</a></blockquote>

<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I just wrote the first one as <a href="https://github.com/torrez/callme">a simple script</a> that demonstrates how to do it with <a href="http://twilio.com/">Twilio</a>. If I actually had real free time I would build a little web UI where you could fill in the numbers, set a time, and get your own personalized conference room (with all the features you find in a regular conferencing system) to <strong>dial you</strong> and the participants when it’s time for the call.</p>

<p>But maybe that’s something you want to build?</p>

<p>The one thing I learned from this is Twilio is pretty damn cool. The documentation is good and the API is a good one.</p>
