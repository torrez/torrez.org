<p>I want a <a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews">river of news</a> items generated by all the people in my company and what they're doing. Something like the Torrez Notes/Sippey/Facebook design where I can see that Frank just closed the build, Justin fixed a bug, and James sold a huge campaign.</p>

<p>Thankfully we have a platform where we can direct that flow to an XML feed if we wanted to, but does this sound like something anyone else would like at their job? I think so.</p>
