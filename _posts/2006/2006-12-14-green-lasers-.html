Who is buying all <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/lights/5a47/">these</a> <a href="http://www.bigha.com/laser/index.php">green</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=green+laser">lasers</a>?
</p>
<p>
Is there some sort of secret drug manufacturing step that requires green lasers? Ick... is there such a thing as Laser Play? Does it have to do something with DRM/DMCA/BluRay? Are they about to be banned or something? </p>
<p>
Everywhere I turn for Christmas I see lasers. Lasers! Buy a Green Laser! It's green! It's brighter! Was my old laser weak? Who is buying these green lasers?
