<p>Two great pieces of Sonic Youth showed up this weekend. </p>

Someone noticed a similarity between Brad and Angelina in Italy, Ray Pettibon's album cover for &quot;Goo&quot;, and the original photo taken in 1966 of a &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot;... It's no &quot;Lincoln killed in Ford's Theater, and Kennedy killed in Ford automobile&quot;, but it's neat nonetheless.<br />

And...

I used to follow SY pretty closely until whatever album came out after &quot;Goo&quot;. I couldn't even tell you what the album was. It was one of those things where I just worshiped and collected anything I could get my hands on, and one day I just stopped listening. </p>

<p>And although it coincided with their small pop stardom that was blown out of the water by their protégés Nirvana, I don't think it had anything to do with it. </p>

<p>I can't even identify with the person who traded live bootlegs with other people in the dorm and ran a BBS called &quot;Silver Rocket BBS&quot; in homage to a song off &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; (yeah, I know, stupid name but would you have gone to Master-Dik BBS?). </p>

<p>I can listen to them now, mostly &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; and &quot;Goo&quot;+&quot;Moo&quot; (the Goo demo tapes produced by JMascis), but only as songs from my past. Whenever I've picked up a new SY album I am completely turned off and regret thinking I could enjoy them again. There's just nothing there that I like and nothing I can understand. </p>

<p>Sonic Youth was my first music crush. I never understood deadheads, or worse, Pink Floyd-heads (do they have names? Owners of silly stickers?) but almost instantly I became the alternative music-geek version of a deadhead or owner of a silly sticker: The Sonic Youth Fan.</p>

<p>I bought or copied everything. I owned rare EPs and even rarer demos of EPs that existed just because someone left some recording equipment running. It was stupid.</p>
