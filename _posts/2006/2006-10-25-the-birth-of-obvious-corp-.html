<p>On the subject of small, I think it's difficult for people to understand why small (really small) and autonomous is best. They are stuck in the the old-view of &quot;We have to do everything or we're going to DIE&quot;. (or worse: we're going to have to take a second round of funding.) </p>

<p>Its unfortunate because small, focused groups intent on making a simple, useful product are all I ever want to be a part of. An absolute nightmare to me would be one of those drones working on some save-the-world SAP installation that never gets off the ground--or one of those startups with a million ideas on how to ignore what they originally were building in the first place.</p>

<p>One quote from his post made me pretty sad, because it illustrates of the shortsightedness in humans: &quot;Nearly everyone I know in the Internet business is either at one of the
giants, wishing they were at a startup, or at a startup that hopes get
bought by a giant.&quot; </p>

<p>If we thought in 5 year chunks (rather than 6-month or even month-to-month) I think we'd see a lot more thoughtful, planned companies, and less people freaked out about diluting their stock. Also awesome: 401ks.</p>

<p>A book I recently enjoyed: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Small-Giants-Companies-Choose-Instead/dp/1591840937">Small Giants: Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big</a> </p>
