I really do &#9829; TypeKey. So much so that I started a little <a href="http://typekey.torrez.org/">TypeKey Wiki</a> that puts some TypeKey links together for developers looking to implement the sign-on service.
</p>
<p>
I invite you to add your own links and text where appropriate.

<p>
I'm also running this system on <a href="http://www.instiki.org/">Instiki</a> which is a fine wiki for this sort of thing. I made some edits this morning to the source code and it was really fairly painless.
