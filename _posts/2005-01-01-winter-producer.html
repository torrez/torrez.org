My friend <a href="http://gominosensei.org/">Jason</a> is on a roll. First he sent out <a href="http://tinyblip.com/passpod/">Pass Pod</a> to the world, and then followed it up immediately with another great idea: the <a href="http://preshrunk.info/">Preshrunk</a> blog.
</p>

Along with books, CDs, and DVDs, I tend to buy a lot of t-shirts since they fall in that sweet $15-25 range. Jason not only blogs the shirts, but he tells you the price, and whether they accept PayPal or not. (Dear people who sell shirts, use PayPal)

I renewed a bunch of my domains recently and I realized I tend to launch sites around this time of the year (December/January). I think slow work weeks, cold weather, and new toys get the creative juices flowing.
