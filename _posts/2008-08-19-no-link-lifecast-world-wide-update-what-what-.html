<p>No link on this post, but we (<a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/">FM</a>) just moved to the City (San Francisco) and everyone is in a state of shock at how different life has become. I just went down to the market in our building and bought an onigiri rice ball. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri">ONIGIRI RICE BALL</a>! I always hoped they've have buckets of rice balls in heaven, never did I imagine I'd have them within walking distance. </p>

<p>I've gone back to public transportation after having a car for a couple of months. It was nice having it, but in the end it was a hassle having to think about the drive. Plus I really like taking public transportation when it is not a bus. Check back with me when MUNI breaks down and I have to walk 7 miles. </p>

<p>Also, MUNI is my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/897777952/">favorite</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/175935100/">source</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/224173349/">of</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/2173436246/">photos</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, our building? Yeah, it's <a href="http://www.city-data.com/picfilesv/picv26613.php">the building</a> that appeared in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers_(film)">Sneakers</a>. Be jealousâ€¦or, you know, <a href="http://federatedmedia.net/about/jobs/">join us</a>.</p>
