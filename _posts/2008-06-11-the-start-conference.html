<p>This looks interesting, <a href="http://www.thestartconference.com/">The Start Conference</a>:</p>

<p><em>Start is a one-day conference in San Francisco designed for smart, talented Web people to take hold of their ideas, follow their dreams, and start their own companies.</em></p>

<p>That's one sweet site, too. See you there.</p>
