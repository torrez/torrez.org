<p>Okay, so that took a lot longer than I had hoped.</p>

<p>Dungeon was reborn and in the process I killed Dungeon. I managed to get it back to working order, but it isn’t exactly where I want it to be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile! I get to work on <a href="http://slack.com/">Slack</a> every day. Less than a month after the previous post I joined TinySpeck as a PHP engineer. It’s a lot of fun and I feel pretty lucky to be a part of it.</p>

<p>I won’t make any promises about my next post, but if you did read this I would really like an <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@torrez">@torrez</a> or an email sent to my address over there on the right.</p>
