Dear friends, <a href="http://store.muledesign.com/detail/sos_m.html">buy this shirt</a>. All profits are going to the Red Cross.

Remember when <a href="http://www.reddkross.com/">Redd Kross</a> was the shit? I do. Was that just an LA thing? Possibly. That is Redd Kross and not <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/KrisKross/html/kkhmpge.html">Kriss Kross</a>. I must admit, in like 92 I put my pants on backwards on purpose for like 10 minutes and walked around the house. Watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Box_%28TV_channel%29">The Box</a> while unemployed and bored made me do shit like that. I will tell you all a story about my Taylor Dayne inspired shenanigans some other day.
