<p><a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=30482">Remarkable</a>. The XBox 360 managed to outsell (by about 200 units) Sony's PlayStation 3 in Japan last week. That's huge. </p>

<p>The XBox 360 is an excellent console. Knock Microsoft all you want but the Xbox team really hit it out of the park on their second try. The PS3 might dominate next year, and the Wii might inhabit a dusty spot in everyone's TV stand, but the 360 owned 2007. found on <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/">Wonderland</a>, will not see on <a href="http://www.sonydefenseforce.com/">Sony Defense Force</a>.</p>
