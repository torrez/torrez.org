<p>Every month I open my bank and credit card statements and do a quick scan of everything I was charged or paid for. Most of the time it’s what I expected, sometimes I have to spend a couple of seconds thinking what a “LMNOP**CORP**TACO” is, and once in a  while it’s completely perplexing and I have to either call the phone number or do a fair amount of Googling.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef01676744ad92970b-pi" alt="Screen Shot 2012 06 09 at 4 21 34 PM" title="Screen Shot 2012-06-09 at 4.21.34 PM.png" border="0" width="440" height="312" /></p>

<p>A few weeks ago there was a charge on my card with an entry like CONDENAST**SERVICES and a phone number. I called the number but nobody answered. I called back the next day and left a message. I called back the third day and the person on the line didn’t know, but we figured it out after she asked me a few questions. (it was my ArsTechnica subscription auto-renewing)</p>

<p>The process of starting up a new Quickbooks or Mint account and tagging and classifying my payments is onerous to me. But I also hate having to go back every month and get a glimpse of my money at one moment in time. I want something that will notify me when a payment or charge occurs giving me a chance to classify or make a note or even schedule a time to followup on the charge.</p>

<p>Just like carrying a Fitbit and having a quick way to see how many steps I’ve taken in a day, having a view into my bank account in real-time as money is deducted would be very welcomed. </p>

<p>So my question is: does anyone do this? Does anyone know how I could pull my bank and credit charges into one place to then fire off actions when something new is seen? I’m assuming <a href="http://www.ofx.net/">OFX</a> but if there is something easier I can simply plug into I’d rather do that.</p>
