<p>I had a really nice birthday today. </p>

<p>I was alone in my office and away from son who is too sick to go to school, so I was a bit sad about that. But then someone on Twitter remembered it was my birthday, and as other people noticed they wished me a happy birthday. I was on a conference call with a client and they broke into a happy birthday song at the end of the call.</p>

<p>I put a good day in and got some stuff done, but I’m leaving a bit early to spend the rest of today with my family.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://mlkshk.typepad.com/mlkshk/2011/09/state-of-the-shake.html">briefly mentioned it</a> in our last State of the Shake but this has been a very challenging couple of months for us as we split our time between contracting and working on MLKSHK. When I left my job I signed up for challenging so it’s to be expected, but this was a nice way to end the month. </p>

<p>Thanks, friends.</p>
