I sometimes query friends for feedback on my projects, but sometimes they are busy or aren't online. I decided to <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/makingstuff">start a Google Group</a> for those of us who make these kinds of sites to get support. A place for anyone with a new site idea to come and get feedback or help out others who are trying to launch a site.

<p>
As I state on the group's charter: A group dedicated to those of us who build web sites in our spare time for fun or profit. Discuss new ideas, feasibility, and get or give help to others.
