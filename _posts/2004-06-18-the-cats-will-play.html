<li>Boss is away. Yay. Before she left she sent me an email that she only asssigned me "one FogBugz item to fix!" That FogBugz item contains about 10 changes to the CMS that are pretty unrelated. :)</li>
<li><a href="http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt">Cory's talk at MSFT</a> on the subject of DRM is a must-read today.</li>
<li>Mat Honan started a Mac blog. The url is currently <a href="http://mac.honan.net.hg.sabren.com/">http://mac.honan.net.hg.sabren.com</a> but he says that will change to mac.honan.net later. From now on call him "Mac"</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/">Kokogiak</a> redesigned. It's very pretty.</li>
