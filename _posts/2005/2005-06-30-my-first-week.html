<p>You know you've gone and fell into something good when you leave work on your first day and you see a deer walking across the street. And so you wait for the deer to cross the road, and the person coming the other direction, who has undoubtedly seen this sort of thing many times, calmly looks down at his cell phone or latte and waits for the deer to decide what the deer is going to do. </p>

<p>John just published a list of <a href="http://fmpub.net/archives/2005/06/fms_mores.php">FM's values</a> that make me feel pretty good about what we're going to be doing here. I'm proud to work somewhere that not only understands what weblogging is about, but understands how important it is to keep those conversations authentic or else it'll all just fall apart.<br /> </p>

<p>Like I said, I sure fell into something good.<br /> </p>
