We got about this || close to taking the first one we saw (pictured on the right), but realized we'd be making a big mistake not waiting to see if we could do better. It wasn't a bad place, and the landlord was incredibly nice and helpful, but who takes the first thing they see? Not us.

One cab driver told us it was much better in San Francisco as he'd lived in &quot;LA&quot; (Woodland Hills) for a few years and was re-located to SF. His allergies disappeared and he said he felt healthier--despite being laid off almost immediately after arriving. Thanks, man.

The story did get him a better tip, though.

Any apartment hunting tips would be greatly appreciated. We like Noe Valley, the pan handle region (?), and Cole Valley but not set on them.
