<p>I don't mean to get all cliched blogger on you, but last night I had a dream I was on Jeopardy and the final Jeopardy question (yeah, it was a dream, dreams don't follow the Jeopardy rules) was &quot;Name one song from Len's 1999 album 'You Can't Stop The Bum Rush' that was <strong>not </strong>'Steal My Sunshine'.&quot;</p>

<p>I panicked. I had no idea. Yeah, I remembered that one song, but did they even have other songs? They must have if there was an album.</p>

<p>So today I actually went to Amazon and looked up Len's album and found out they had a song called &quot;<span class="tiny">Cheekybugger&quot;. I committed it to memory.</span></p>
