I had dinner with Anil the other night and he urged me to add a small feature I had been putting off to <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/">Dropcash</a>. Someone, it might have been me, said during dinner "How can you facilitate the movement of money and not make any money?" It's a real head scratcher, eh?
</p>
<p>
So I added the feature today. When your campaign goal is reached you receive an email informing you of this, and a link suggesting a small donation based on a percentage of your goal. I then round-robin PayPal addresses between me and Jason. We'll see how that goes.

<p>
More features coming soon.
