title: Bots!

<p>A few years ago I was into programming AIM bots. I wrote one for Metafilter that would scrape the RSS feed and send out a couple hundred IMs to people informing them of the latest posts to Mefi. I ran into the &quot;too many messages&quot; wall and gave up on the bot. I didn't feel like creating a web of bots, like my friend Phil Fibiger did, and so I let the bot die.</p>

<p>A couple years later Andy rigged his AIM bot to the Infocom interpreter, and let loose a few Infocom games to the world. It was wildly popular, and tonight while researching some AIM bots for something entirely different, I ran into something I hadn't seen in a while. Andy had registered infocombots 1-3, and someone else decided to register infocombot4.</p>

<p>As they say on the Internet, <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/03/25/infocomb.shtml">hilarity ensued</a> (read comment #6).</p>
