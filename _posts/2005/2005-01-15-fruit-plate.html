<p>
I can't decide if it's because I'm getting old or because I live in California, but when the waitress (at the sports bar where "the guys" were watching the game and drinking beer) asked me if I wanted any food, I skipped past the fried cheese, fried onions, and nachos to the fruit plate.

And a side of yogurt for dipping.
