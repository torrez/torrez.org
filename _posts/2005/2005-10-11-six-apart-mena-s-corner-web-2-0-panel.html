<a title="Six Apart - Mena's Corner: Web 2.0 Panel" href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/corner/2005/10/web_20_panel.html">This made my day</a>. Not because Mena thinks she said something dumb, she probably didn't, but because whatever I said had some germ of truth in it and Mena liked it. I say a lot of dumb things, but I say them in front of a small number of people who know that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>I say a lot of dumb things.</li>
<li>Maybe the dumb thing Andre just said should have been phrased differently, and if so then that actually makes some sense.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Anyway, I fret about things I say here (and now about things I say on LJ!) but it's nice knowing that people still get it, however poorly worded.

Also, thank god I don't have more than the 100 or so readers who keep visiting my site. I can't imagine what it would be like if things were scrutinized as much as they are on the more popular sites.
