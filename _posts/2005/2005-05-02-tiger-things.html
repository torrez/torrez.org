<p>
I noticed two Tiger things that I think are pretty cool.

<ol>
	<li>Toss iChatStatus in the trash. iChat now allows you to set your status to whatever song is playing in iTunes.</li>
	<li><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=623,height=443,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://torrez.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/networkdiagnostics.png"><img width="100" height="71" border="0" src="http://notes.torrez.org/images/networkdiagnostics.png" title="Networkdiagnostics" alt="Networkdiagnostics" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The Network Diagnostics was very useful. It allows you to troubleshoot your connection problem by walking you through each point in your connection. Starting with the settings on your computer hardware, through the line to your access point, to your ISP, and then out onto the Internet. Was this in Panther? I don't know, but it sure did come in handy when I first started up Tiger and didn't have a connection.</li>
</ol>
