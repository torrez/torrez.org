I run <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/">Dropcash</a>. We just surpassed the $73,000 (wow) mark for people using us to track their PayPal fundraisers, and we are looking to clear $100,000 by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people email me because Dropcash does <em>almost</em> what they want to do but they need it to do some other thing that is specific to their project. I think on a weekly basis someone asks me to code them up some PayPal function that any programmer could do if they saw the API. It's terrifyingly simple, and I think there are still a million ideas out there that could be offered up in the way Dropcash is.
</p>
<p>
This makes me think two things: 1. PayPal needs to do more with their API and tools. The fact that people email me asking how to do something that PayPal could already do for them in a couple hours of work is remarkable. 2. Someone could make a good amount of money providing PayPal solutions all day. And, I guess 3. Someone who wanted to be a PayPal API developer should just buy Dropcash off me to use as a calling card.
</p>
<p>
For whatever reason PayPal does what they think is best for their company and maybe $73,000 or $100,000 of pass-through is not a big deal to them. I just feel like there are a lot of opportunities out there for people to get money moving faster and easier, and nobody is taking advantage of it.
