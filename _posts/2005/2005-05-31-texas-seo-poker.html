I give up. The SEO goons have won this round as I've taken <a href="http://typekey.torrez.org/">Everything TypeKey</a> down for re-tooling. You can still access the site, you just can't edit it. Please tell me if there are any missing pages or links to SEO spam.

<a href="http://www.instiki.org/">Instiki</a> needs TypeKey support!
