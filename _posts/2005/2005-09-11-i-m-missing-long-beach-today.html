Since moving up to San Francisco I've been pretty excited about this city, but today I kept thinking about 2nd Street, driving over to Fingerprints to buy another CD I don't need, or just standing out on the beach in the warm (hot) sand. <br /><br />I miss that stretch of Bellflower Blvd. where you can get anything you want, provided it's electronics, housewares, food, or books. I miss weather that you don't even notice...<br /><br />And believe it or not I miss driving 3 miles to a parking-lot, circling for 2 miles looking for parking, and then walking nearly a mile to wherever you originally wanted to go in the first place. Yeah, I miss that.<br /><br />Most of all I miss living in the same part of the state as my family and nearly every one of my friends that I know face-to-face. I miss the people at IM and the strange folks who lived on my street. I miss my pick-up truck and the way the door wouldn't open unless you threw your shoulder into it.<br /><br />I miss my scissors. In a fit of Express&trade; packing I left my drawer of random bits of string, scissors, rubber bands, batteries, buttons, and assorted plastic things that you find around the house and just know you'll need someday.<br /><br />We bought a set of scissors at Ikea yesterday, and when we got home I pulled them out of the bag and noticed they were tied together with a piece of thick plastic. I realized I didn't have scissors to get to my new scissors, and it made me remember all the crap I gave up by moving here. (oh so poignant, don't you think?)<br /><br />It's not all bad, of course, I'm doing this with the one person I couldn't leave behind, and wouldn't have left behind.<br clear="all" />
