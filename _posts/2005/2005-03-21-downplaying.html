<p>
We have a new IA at work helping with our site re-design and we've become lunch
friends, usually talking about some idea for a site or project. Today while
walking back from eating he brought up something that had happened the previous
week. We had been at my desk and <a href="http://waxy.org/">Andy</a>
IM'd me that Dropcash was mentioned in a Nature.com story of a
<a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/mashup/preso.html">talk given at ETech</a>.
I pointed it out to him, and then, according to him, downplayed it to the point
of apologizing for even bringing up the subject. I am pretty sure I said something
like, &quot;Oh, it's this stupid thing I did...&quot;
</p>
<p>
He said it was a peculiar reaction to something someone should be proud of, and
we talked about how it's my general reaction to any projects I do being discussed.
</p>
<p>
I decided on our walk back from lunch, that this attitude is rooted in two things.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>At work I'm totally on it when it comes to pointing out our tech team's projects,
	yet when I'm doing stuff outside of work I feel that it's &quot;play&quot; and so I don't
	take it as seriously. Had someone at ETech discussed my very cool dynamic javascript
	publishing CMS which fakes dynamic content for Sony's Latin America web site,
	I'd probably be all over it. I'd have shirts made. But stuff like <a href="http://www.johnzeratsky.com/archives/000617.php">announcing TKPal</a> not so much.</li>
	<li>Lana Turner was discovered at Schwab's Drugstore sipping soda. I have some
	idealistic dream of someone calling me up from the minors I think. That sounds so lame.</li>
</ol>

<p>
But yeah, I creep people out sometimes when I start sentences with, &quot;I have this
really stupid idea, but...&quot;
</p>
