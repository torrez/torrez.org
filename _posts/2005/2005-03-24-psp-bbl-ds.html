I got the new Sony PSP in an amazing peer-induced hysteria. I showed up to work today and some of the guys were making a run for the Toys 'R Us down the road. Before I knew what I was doing I had committed to buying one.

Now that I have it in my hands it's an amazing gadget. Can I call it a gadget? Appliance? It's beautiful. The screen is beautiful. The fact that it has a USB port and real working, standards compliant (AFAIK) WiFi is incredible. The number of applications that could be written seem limitless.
