This might be an old link, since I thought I had read it before, but while adding the cent sign to <a href="http://www.simpleform.com/TKPal">TKPal</a> I ran across this piece called <a href="http://www.charlieanderson.com/centsign.htm">The Demise Of The $.01 Sign</a>.

I like the Â¢ sign. If you want to help bring it back, please use &amp;#162; in your HTML.</p>

<p>If you're on a Mac, just type alt+4 which is the $ when shifted key.</p>

<p>If you're on a PC I think you type alt+0162.</p>
