<p>
My new favorite place to go for lunch is <a href="http://www.4lifeco.com/">Fresh In The Box</a>. If you're in the LA area and want insanely good tasting food made to order, you have to try this place out.

<p>
Read through the site and you'll get a sense of what the restaurant is like. JPop bubbling from the kitchen, and out front there's Hip-Hop streaming out of an XM radio that sits next to Japanese artwork.

Note the link for jobs is the only thing that's written in Japanese.
