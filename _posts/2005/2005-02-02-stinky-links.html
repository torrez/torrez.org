My friend <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/02/stinky_links.html">Matt</a> pointed out how some people's sites he reads are evolving into a handful of links sprinkled with some jokey commentary. It's true, I'm one of those people he's referring to. I promised myself I'd get stuff up on this site this year and part of that has meant that I fall back on del.icio.us links, rather than what I should be doing which is just sitting down for twenty minutes and writing something when I have the time. Quality over quantity, maybe.

Part of why I've been so excited about <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> and using it to post links is that I'm writing some API thing that will make it simpler for me to publish my links to TypePad. I guess I've gone a bit overboard. I see a lot of links in a day, and sometimes I just want to save them for my own use, so why not get them up on the site too? Unfortunately TypePad doesn't allow the finer tuning of widths and styles that might be needed, so I'm working to help get around that.

One thing about using TypePad is that it forces you to be a little creative with how you do things. It's kind of like what Matt (the hater) <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/01/please_fence_me.html">said about people liking limits</a>. I chose to work with TypePad rather than my own MT install for a few reasons, but chief among them is that I liked the idea of being constrained with a very narrow-use blogging application. If MovableType is the car then TypePad is my scooter.

I picked TypePad because I find it makes me think more creatively about solutions for getting it to do what I want it to do. I figure there's a lot of people out there who might be dealing with those same problems but not know how to program, and that's just the kind of group I like to help out.
