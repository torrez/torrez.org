I can't remember if I'd ever brought this up, but I had an idea for desserts at restaurants. It's always so difficult to decide on what dessert to get, and sometimes you don't even want a whole cheesecake or tort, so how about some restaurant serves spoonfuls of dessert?

Imagine it: 50&cent; a spoon for cheesecake, apple pie, maybe two apple pies, a cherry pie, some angel food cake with strawberries...
