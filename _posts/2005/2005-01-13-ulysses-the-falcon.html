<p>
I actually went to a <a href="http://www.recordstorereview.com/cgi-bin/store?getStore=855">physical record store</a> and bought CDs. Used CDs no less. Very rare for me since I spend my life in front of a computer.

While checking out, and probably due to having two Minders albums and some Dub Narcotic EPs, I got <a href="http://www.torrez.org/media/mp3/Ulysses%20-%20The%20Falcon.mp3">this promo CD single</a>. I've never been a fan of Apples in Stereo but I do like this song. <a href="http://www.eeniemeenie.com/artists/ulysses/index.php">More on Ulysses</a>.

They're playing today at <a href="http://www.amoebamusic.com/html/">Amoeba Records</a> in LA.
