I did something a few months ago that I just realized was having a positive effect on my day. I turned off the automatic checking of email in my client. Someone, probably <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin</a>,  suggested this a few months ago, and I did it to try it out.

It just occurred to me that I have been working this way for a few months and I realized my interruption rate has fallen quite a bit. I'm one of those programmers who can either be programming or not programming, not both. If I'm doing some production or busy monkey work for they day, it's hard to step back into programming mode without a bit of jump-starting. Same for when I'm programming, getting sidetracked with minor items for the day tends to derail the project a bit.

Anyway, if you're feeling a little interrupted during your day, try it out.
