I recently downloaded the new beta of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php">NetNewsWire</a> and while going through the new options I chose for it to download and install <a href="http://www.ipodder.org/whatIsPodcasting">podcasts</a> automatically.
</p>
<p>
That, in itself, is a pretty neat feature. Yay Ranchero.
</p>
<p>
So this morning I notice a new playlist in my iTunes. "<a href="http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cnJan12.mp3">It's Dave Winer!</a>" I think to myself and happily start it up. Technology!
</p>
<p>
It's not that it isn't good, it's that Dave sounds like I'd think Jerry Garcia would sound. I don't want to listen to Jerry Garcia. I'm not making fun of Dave, I'm just pointing out that audio adds too many variables for me. Sound of the voice. Background noise. Ums. Uhs. NPR has me spoiled.
</p>
<p>
But yes also it isn't good. I really didn't pay attention to what he was saying, just how it was being delivered. I think podcasting is a cool use of technology, but so are <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/09/02/rncnyc_reported_pres.html">LRADs</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's just not something I can get excited about. Ranchero making it happen, yes, listening to random thoughts, not so much. I'm sure for Dave it's pretty damn cool to be able to do it, but it's not my thing.
</p>
<p>
No, my thing is coordinating in iChat with <a href="http://www.honan.net/">Mat</a>, who is at Macworld, to go in front of the <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/Macworld/onthefloor/cam.cfm">Other World Computing</a> live camera and flip me off.

Technology! I'm living it.
