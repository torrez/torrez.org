title: Programmer Self-Improvement Books
---
<p>
Blame <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>, but I've become enamored with the idea of writing short, concise books on the subject of programming. (Maybe not me writing them, but <em>somebody</em> writing them.) Along the lines of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/020161622X/qid=1118177417/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-6428999-0704738?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619670/ref=pd_bxgy_text_1/104-6428999-0704738?v=glance&s=books&st=*">Code Complete</a> but with the goal of examining a single concept.
</p>
<p>
As an employee of a marketing company I've picked up a couple of <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/books.html">Seth's books</a> and have been able to apply some of the concepts to our discussions. Since I didn't go to any sort of marketing school, finding myself in the middle of a medium-sized marketing company compelled me to do some digging into marketing concepts.
</p>
<p>
I like that Seth's books are piecemeal and stick to one subject rather than trying to tackle a ton of concepts at once. The books are, by no coincidence I'm sure, small and easy to handle. I never find myself wanting to skip chapters like so many programmer focused books (the above books included) and I never feel left out of the conversation--meaning so many books end up focusing on the languages rather than concepts, and when those languages are Microsoft-centric I get turned off by them.
</p>
<p>
Taking a cue from Seth I think there's a group of programmers with a world-view that their programming process, though good, can do with some small insight on how to make it better. That every programmer has certain areas of their process which could use some modification and would like to work on those specific areas rather than do a complete overhaul.
