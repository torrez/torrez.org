Where I used to work there was a quote on one of the doors from David Ogilvy, "When you advertise fire-extinguishers, open with the fire."
</p>
<p>
I always liked that quote because it's something often missed when people are trying to explain what they're selling or even just trying to convey. I see this happen the most on web sites for applications that have a strong visual component. I can never understand why someone who wrote an application that does X doesn't have a nice screenshot on the front page showing it do X.

This entry started because <a href="http://kottke.org/">Jason</a> pointed me towards a MovableType plug-in called <a href="http://www.staggernation.com/mtplugins/BigPAPI/">BigPAPI</a> that does something <strong>very</strong> cool and <strong>very</strong> visual (allows plug-ins to affect MT's interface), yet there are no screenshots to be found.
