While walking in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castro">The Castro</a> we come upon the words<br />
G E T O<br />
B O Y S<br />
somewhat randomly drawn on the ground in chalk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me:</strong> That's weird. This doesn't seem like the sort of neighborhood where people would be into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geto_Boys">Geto Boys</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Her:</strong> It says<br />
G E T<br />
B O Y S<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me:</strong> Ahhh, that's different then.
