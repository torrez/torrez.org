<p>
I just turned live some new <a href="http://www.simpleform.com/TKPal/">TKPal</a> code with some great updates from <a href="http://www.cowpimp.com/">Bill Zeller</a>. He wrote a database class that generalizes the functions through drivers. So now there is a flat file option as well as a MySQL option.

I updated the instructions as well. If you previously downloaded the code, please go back and download again. Remember: you can always go back as often as you wish and download as many times as you wish.
