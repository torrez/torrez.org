I'm on the cusp of releasing something I think is pretty cool, so I've been writing and re-writing it to make sure it works how I want it to. One of the last steps has been deciding how to license it.

I have to admit I don't spend very much of my time thinking about licenses since I very rarely release open sourced code for use or example. I find the whole matter kind of boring (except for the 2 days after seeing Lessig speak or reading some of Doctorow's work for the EFF), and so it feels something like choosing car insurance.

I'm not writing the next great word processor, it's just a couple hundred lines of PHP to help people sell content on the web, and so  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">that</a> is bloody awful, and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">that</a> is probably more my style. I can see why people just &copy; and move on with things.
