I came home from work last night to find an email in my inbox telling me <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> had been released. It's a cataloging system for books, movies, music, and video games with some very cool features like using your iSight (finally a use!) camera to scan barcodes, seamless integration with Amazon, as well as storing everything in an XML format for easy parsing and exporting. Your inventory can be "checked-out" to people on your borrowers list which conveniently draws from your OS X address book.
</p>
<h4>The Good</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Simple interface, I didn't even have to read the directions. After looking at screenshots for the past few months I immediately started scanning in my library without a problem.</li>
	<li>The iSight scanner is kind of fun to use. After a hundred pieces of media checked-in I've gotten pretty good with the thing.</li>
	<li>The XML format means I can easily write a shell script to do things with the data. </li>
	<li>There's a menu option that takes you to the first step for selling your item on Amazon. It'd be nice if there was an Ebay link as well.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Bad</h4>
<ol>
	<li>The iSight scanner doesn't always work. Some barcodes have to be manually typed in. I expected this to happen, but I can't justify buying a barcode reader.</li>
	<li>I'd like to be able to use the iSight to take photos for some of my items that don't have Amazon photos from inside the software. I can't even drag a photo on top of the library items. It'd be nice if there were more options for how the media is displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>
After using it for less than an hour I knew I wanted to buy it. It's a great product and if you're the sort of person that enjoys cataloging and filing, this is a must-have piece of software.
