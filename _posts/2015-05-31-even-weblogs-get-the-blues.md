**HEY**, hi, it’s me and I am back. First I want to thank [Matthew McVickar](http://matthewmcvickar.com/) for getting all of this back into one location on one installation (not dungeon! :cry:) but a very good amalgamation of tools that map to what I wanted dungeon to be. I just didn’t have time to be taking on a project like that because…

**GOSH**, we have two kids, ages 2 and 6. And we just bought a house here in SF. An actual real, live single-family home in the Richmond district. I know, I am shocked too. I never thought that would happen but there it is. It’s 100+ years old and beautiful and tall and all that sort of San Francisco architecture stuff. More on that later…

**WOW**, I work at [Slack](http://slack.com/) which is pretty cool. I’m about to complete my first year there this week. I love it. It’s great. You should [join us](https://slack.com/jobs). I can’t say enough great things about the people and the product.

**[MLKSHK](http://mlkshk.com/)** still exists. Unfortunately both Amazon and Tugboat Yards (the people who did the subscription processing) are closing subscriptions due to different reasons and I/we have to find a solution quick. Hopefully it will all just work itself out like that weird clicking in my elbow I kept meaning to see a doctor about…

**I JUST** [read this interview](http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/05/dooce-talks-life-after-mommy-blogging.html) with Dooce that you should probably also check out. When the roaring blogging days of the 2000’s were upon us and Heather was with Federated Media everytime she’d introduce us at events or to people she was standing with she’d call us “her people” in a totally endearing, affectionate way. I started reading Dooce in those early days when we both lived in LA and happened to know a few of the same people.

**SOMETHING** about that interview and reading her talk about those years gave me a little kick in the pants to get this site back up and working again. I am glad to be back. I really am back, I swear.
