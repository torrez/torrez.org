title: Ripping DRM Out Of Apple's iTunes Songs
---
<p>
My friend <a href="http://mac.honan.net/">Mat</a> just showed me this: <a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/25695">Report: iMovie strips FairPlay DRM from iTunes songs</a>. I just did it with a song I bought off of iTunes a couple days ago, and it worked with only one hitch. Exporting as AIFF made a 38 meg file which had to be ran through iTunes to get it to a manageable size.

It's easier to use <a href="http://hymn-project.org/">Hymn</a>, but this would do in a pinch.
