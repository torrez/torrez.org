I saw the Pixies last night at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. It was hot but once the show started I forgot about the heat. Great show, great sound (when it was working), lots of nice people who really loved the Pixies, and a great Indian dinner afterward with friends.

Since the concert was above the UC campus we had to walk through the north end of it and I got to see parts of the campus I hadn't seen in nearly 13 years. It's definitely been cleaned up and buildings that had been hidden behind ivy have been landscaped and painted. It made me wish I had finished college.
