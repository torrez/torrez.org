<p>I started playing this game last night called <a href="http://swiftstitch.sophiehoulden.com/">Swift Stitch</a> and haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I guarantee it is unlike any game you’re playing now. (Unless you’re playing Vib Ribbon or Tron.)</p>

<p>There is a demo for both Mac and PC as well as a web embedded (you can embed Unity games!?) <a href="http://swiftstitch.sophiehoulden.com/demo/">demo</a> so you can try it out.</p>

<p>Her <a href="http://www.sophiehoulden.com/blog/swiftstitch-post-mortem/">post-mortem</a> on the game is definitely worth reading.</p>
