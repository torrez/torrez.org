<p><a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2011/12/vim-revisited/">Vim: revisited</a> is such a good introduction to getting started with Vim. I wish I would have read it before I started my NoVimBer project.</p>

<p>Not using too many plugins was pretty much my undoing. The point he makes about the Janus distribution is spot-on. If I had to do it again I might no have switched to <a href="http://vicoapp.com">Vico</a> so quickly.</p>
