title: Netflix Crazy

<p>
I've gone Netflix crazy over the past couple of weeks&#8212;stepping up to the 5 DVDs at a time plan. I've nearly finished the first series of "<a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=60030505&trkid=73">24</a>", and I have been slowly building a queue of documentaries I've missed over the past couple of years. I don't live in the sort of neighborhood where very many documentaries are available for rent, so I tend to buy a lot of them when renting would do.

I just downloaded <a href="http://www.thelittleappfactory.com/software/netflixfreak.php">Netflix Freak</a>, which provides you with a Mac Cocoa interface instead of the web interface. So far the only advantage I can see is that I can drag and drop my queue.

Added <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/netflix/">Hacking Netflix</a>'s RSS feed as well.
