This seemed a lot funnier when I first copied and pasted it from a chat window this afternoon. Now at 6pm it's not nearly as funny. They were files that we waited all day Friday for.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me</strong>: We didn't get the files until Monday morning, so we're still getting a handle on the CSS.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Them</strong>: I sent the code Saturday morning
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me</strong>: We're not open on Saturday
</p>
<p>
<strong>Me</strong>: Or sunday
</p>
<p>
<strong>Them</strong>: Oh.
</p>
