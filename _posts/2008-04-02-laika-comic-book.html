<p>Here's <a href="http://www.nickabadzis.com/laika/">a microsite for a graphic novel about Laika</a> the first animal in space. Definitely going to buy this one.</p>

<p>It's always so hard to know if a comic book (hate that term graphic novel, it's worse than "adult motel") is right for me, I usually just flip through it real fast to make sure I'm buying something I want to look at for a hundred pages. I can't read the dialog because it usually gives something away, so it's almost always a guessâ€”which is part of the fun, I think. </p>

<p>A new comic book store opened up near our apartment called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/neon-monster-san-francisco">Neon Monster</a>. It's good.</p>
