If you were alive and dressed yourself in the 80's you probably owned one of these shirts and should get this book or buy it for someone as a stocking stuffer provided they have FAT ankles.<br /><br />As you probably know <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/67612166/">I skated a bit</a>, so the skate shirts were pretty cool to see, but the best part of the book is the music shirts. <br /><br />Oh, and there's some bits to read in this too, they interview t-shirt collectors who specialize in different types of shirts. Yeah, if someone asks you what they should get you or you need a Secret Santa gift under $15 get this book.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vintage-T-Shirts-MORE-THAN-AUTHENTIC/dp/0061144622/sr=8-1/qid=1165532961/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6989412-1080945?ie=UTF8&s=books">Amazon Link To Book</a> -- Added bonus, check out the comments. :)<br clear="all" />
