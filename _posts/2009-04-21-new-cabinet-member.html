<p>I think I just found my new <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/magazine/19wwln-q4-t.html?_r=3">favorite cabinet member</a>.</p>

<p><em>
<strong>Was anyone in your family impressed when you won the Nobel Prize in Physics?</strong>
Probably, but who knows? I called my mother up when they announced the Nobel Prize, waiting until 7 in the morning. She said, “That’s nice — and when are you going to see me next?”</p>

<p><strong>Is it true you don’t drive a car? </strong>
My wife does, but I no longer own a car. Let me just say that in most of my jobs, I mostly rode my bicycle.
