title: iPhone Reading Means Less Links
category: del.icio.us
---
<p>I spend a very large amount of time catching up with sites on my commute into work. Since I haven't developed a good workflow for del.icio.us bookmarking while on the device, I'm seeing the rate of my bookmark collection fall.</p>

<p>Apple iPhone update is desperately needed! OMG this iPhone is so outdated!</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>So on with the links:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/2007/07/23/070723sh_shouts_rich">Shouts &amp; Murmurs: Hey, Look: Humor: The New Yorker</a> - I love kidlogic and childhood stories like these. I used to do skate tricks all day in my front yard across from the local grocery story thinking some famous skater would see me and ask me to join his team. Really.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.webcomicsnation.com/minicloud/minicloud/series.php?view=single&amp;ID=81074">&quot;Small Noises&quot; by Sarah Glidden</a> - Fantastic comic. Over the past year I've become a raging nerd for comics. I love them more than weblogs these days. Sorry, weblogs.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.defectiveyeti.com/archives/002169.html">defective yeti: Your Amazon.com Order is Being Prepared for Shipping</a> - I have to admit, the hype got to me. I cracked open the first Potter book and laid down on our bean bag like I was 12 years old again.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000914.html">Coding Horror: What's Wrong With Setup.exe?</a> - What's wrong is it's totally normal in Windows to have an installer install spew all over your HD without discussing it with you. On the Mac I put it where I want it by dragging the file over where I want it to live. You do this once and you're smart enough how to do this forever.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/4219452.html">Airplane Crash - Safest Seat - How to Survive Plane Accident - NTSB Data - Flight Records - Popular Mechanics</a> - Yay for graphics showing me how to cheat death.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.zune-arts.net/">Zune Arts</a> - I'd never seen this site before. The Ratatat one is my favorite.</li>
    <li><a href="http://globalnerdy.com/2007/07/18/laws-of-software-development/">Global Nerdy &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Laws of Software Development</a> - Global Nerdy is so good. Subscribe now!</li>
