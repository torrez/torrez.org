<p>I first became aware of Buster Mcleod from his <a href="http://allconsuming.net/">All Consuming</a> project. He has a lot of projects that seem to spiral off from what he was doing with All Consuming. Projects that track <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/erikbenson/sets/72157611688977395/">a particular time of day</a> on Flickr. Projects that display <a href="http://enjoymentland.com/category/projects/currently-in-season/">what is in season</a> for your location. His Morale-O-Meter used to track his mood and other statuses throughout the week. He sums it up in his post <a href="http://enjoymentland.com/2009/02/07/history-of-my-self-tracking/">"History of my self-tracking"</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>
The reason I am obsessed with self-tracking is because I think there is a way to track yourself in such a way that it leads to epiphanies about yourself, about the cause and effect of things, in such a way that these numbers would eventually be able to tell you things about yourself that you didnâ€™t already know.  This is the only reason to self-track, in my opinion.</em>
