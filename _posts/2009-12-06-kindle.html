<p>"For every 100 copies of a physical book we sell, where we have the Kindle edition, we will sell 48 copies of the Kindle edition." &#8212; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06fob-q4-t.html?_r=1">NYTimes interview with Jeff Bezos.</a></p>

<p>I held off buying a Kindle for myself for longer than is normal. The price was the main reason, but I never thought I'd enjoy reading a book on the device. </p>

<p>When my wife finally bought me one for my birthday I started with tech books. The sort of books you burn through and shelve and never read again. Then it was a quick slide into fiction and now I can't imagine lugging a book around that doesn't have a version on the Kindle. </p>
