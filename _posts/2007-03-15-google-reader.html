<p><a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> just keeps getting better and better. Yesterday I noticed they had added something I, and I bet a few people, asked for. This little refresh button:</p>

<p><img src="http://notes.torrez.org//images/Picture 5.png" border="0" height="56" width="83" alt="Picture 5.png"  /></p>

<p>Previously it had been a link at the bottom that, when clicked, would offer no feedback. If there were updates they'd percolate in, if there were no updates nothing would happen. Clicking it felt like a <em>thunk</em>.</p>

<p>I know this is a small thing to get excited about, but it made me happy to see that last night. The "jackpot" feeling of clicking "get mail" in my mail app and seeing messages come in now exists in my feed-reader and I like that.</p>
