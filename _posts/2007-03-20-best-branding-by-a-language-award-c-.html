title: 'Best Branding By A Language Award: C++'
---
<p>A thought I had in the shower was that "C++" is perhaps the best branding a
computer language has ever had. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++#The_name_.22C.2B.2B.22">Here's more on the naming</a>.
In a culture of "newer is better" who wouldn't want to choose C++ over C? It's like Jaws 2 or the latest iThing. It's something
only programmers (especially C programmers) were able to understand, and anyone learning C or C++ would recognize as being somewhat clever.</p>

<p>What got me on this line of thinking was this post: <a href="http://t-a-w.blogspot.com/2007/02/right-to-criticize-programming.html">taw's blog: The right to criticize programming languages</a>. Be sure and check out the links in each section,
lots of good stuff.</p>
