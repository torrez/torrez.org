I've been tooling with a sentence in my head this morning, but I haven't been able to come up with the right wording.
</p>
<p>
Right now, it's: <em>Solving a problem never feels as proportionally good as the bad feeling of experiencing it.</em>
</p>
<p>
I'll take a crack at it later, but it looks like I'm ending this week on a higher note&#8212;though other problems still exist and require a lot more work to figure out. There is still next week.
