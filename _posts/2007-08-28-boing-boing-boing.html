<p>I am so completely proud that <a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/">FM</a> had a hand in the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/welcome-to-the-new-b.html">relaunch of BoingBoing</a> and the <a href="http://gadgets.boingboing.net/">launch of BoingBoing gadgets</a>. I'll also be the first to admit I had nothing to do with it at all, which makes it even cooler to see the final product. </p>

<p>This is something I think people miss about FM, and I find myself explaining a bit, we're not just an ad network&#8212;we troubleshoot page loads, offer advice, do late night fixes, help with templates, can share our experiences with MT, Wordpress, and Blogger, and of course do bigger stuff like help the Boingers get their new sites up. </p>

<p>Every once in a while I get a chance to demo the platform to someone not familiar with what we're doing. And it ends up being like a shot in the arm to me when I see how excited they get as I take them to interfaces that connect advertisers to sales to publishers and to author services.</p>

<p>Sound like fun? <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/eng/402964267.html">We're hiring</a>.</p>
