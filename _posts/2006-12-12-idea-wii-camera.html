Because it's easier to think up ideas than actually do them, today on the bus I thought it'd be a neat hack to take a Wii controller, and <a href="http://blog.hiroaki.jp/2006/12/000433.html">this code</a> for detecting a Wii's location, tape a video camera onto it and then either scan in a 3d object by moving the Wiimote around it, or generate panoramas by moving your Wiimote from left to right.
