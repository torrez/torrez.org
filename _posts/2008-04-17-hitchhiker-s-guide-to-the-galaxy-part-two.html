<p>If you were a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Interactive_fiction_and_video_games">Infocom's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> you're going to love what Andy's cooked up on <a href="http://waxy.org/">Waxy.org</a> this week. </p>

<p>Someone gave him access to <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/">Infocom's shared network drive</a> and he ran with it. He's got email, design notes, and <em>playable demos</em>! Very cool.</p>
