<p>Amber and I lived a block away from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/garden/23sanfran.html?_r=1">this house</a> for almost three years. You can barely see the <a href="http://www.space-invaders.com/">space invader</a> embedded on the face of it under the stairs. </p>

<p>Every time we walked past it, I would say: "Damn I love this house. I don't know why but I love it." So now I know why.</p>

<p>After a year of looking we finally bought a place here in the city. We're moving in two weeks and we can't be happier with it. It's in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duboce_Triangle,_San_Francisco,_California">Duboce Triangle</a> which is kind of a dream for us. Not only am I 10 minutes from work, but I get to pick between every MUNI train line in the city. It looks like I'll get to use Paul's <a href="http://minimuni.paulhammond.org/">MiniMuni</a> now.</p>
