<p><a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/08/the-internet-is.html">Fred Wilson</a> responds to Mark Cuban's assertion that the Internet is "<a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/08/24/the-internet-is-dead-and-boring/">dead and boring</a>". I love how Fred responds almost exactly how I did when Adaptive Path said <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2005/04/its_a_whole_new.html">something similar</a>.</p>

<p>I love music. Music is always awesome. Anyone whoever says music has gotten boring has gotten boring. I feel that way about most things people get bored with.</p>
