<p><a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/taylor/2008/05/wy_zappos_pays_new_employees_t.html">Zappos has an interesting way of testing new hires</a>, after four weeks if you're not happy about the job and the company, they'll pay you your full salary for the time you've been there, and give you a $500 bonus (possibly $1,000 soon). The reasoning is if you haven't bought into what the company is about, you probably won't be the type of Zappos employee they need.</p>

<p>Oh, also they expect about a billion dollars in sales this year. </p>

<p>If you're not following <a href="http://twitter.com/Zappos">Zappos on Twitter</a>, you should. They're one of the few companies understanding how to use Twitter as a component of their company.</p>
