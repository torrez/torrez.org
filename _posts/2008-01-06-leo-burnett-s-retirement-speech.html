<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WUxb8YB88o">Leo Burnett's retirement speech</a> found on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Burnett">his Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I hadn't heard this fact from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Burnett">Wikipedia</a>: "Burnett's use of the animation medium to sell products was slyly given a nod in the anime series Pok&eacute;mon. Disguised as muffled backwards dialogue, the character James of Team Rocket, is heard mumbling a line in the grip of a Pok&eacute;mon's mouth. The line is "Leo Burnett and 4Kids are the devil, Leo Burnett!", mocking both Leo's introduction of animated commercialism, and Pok&eacute;mon itself, which promotes the Nintendo games of the same title."</p>
