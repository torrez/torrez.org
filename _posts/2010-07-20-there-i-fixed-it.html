I probably don't understand the iPhone 4 antenna attenuation issue (I barely get Photoshop) but…

The internal layout likely dictates why the antenna has the break below rather than above—meaning they needed space for the camera—but still, I was holding my phone and I noticed my finger never goes between those buttons.
