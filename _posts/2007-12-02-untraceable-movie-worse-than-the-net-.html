<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/untraceable/high.html">Untraceable</a> might be the worst tech movie ever made, but the trailer is fucking hilarious. Not as good as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td4VEGiIQmk" title="Don't eat that burger, it's a bomb!">Blow'd Up</a>, but damn close. found on <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2007/12/links_for_20071203/">plastic bag</a>.</p>
