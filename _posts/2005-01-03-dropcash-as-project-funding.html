I love it that <a href="http://www.rayners.org/">David Raynes</a> not only built the <a href="http://www.rayners.org/2004/09/dropcash_plugin.php">Dropcash MovableType plugin</a> and then held the code for <a href="http://www.rayners.org/2004/09/mt_dropcash_plu.php">ransom until his goal was met</a>. He's doing it again with <a href="http://www.rayners.org/2004/12/workflow_05_1.php">this workflow plugin for MovableType</a>.

It's fun to see people use things in ways you didn't really intend. With this new thing I'm getting ready to release, I keep coming up with different ways to use it, but I'm sure someone will surprise me like David has.
