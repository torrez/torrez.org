<p>
Even though Brent has said many times (even putting it in text in the software itself) that the sync function in NetNewsWire 2.0 beta needs work, I was wondering if anyone had figured out a work-around or cause of <a href="http://ranchero.com/bugs/display.php?bugid=1648">this bug</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's keeping me from using NNW at work and it's bumming me out.
</p>
<p>
But <a href="http://torrez.org/media/midi/WhenYouWereMine.mid">this is cheering me up</a> like a cheap, hollow chocolate bunny.
