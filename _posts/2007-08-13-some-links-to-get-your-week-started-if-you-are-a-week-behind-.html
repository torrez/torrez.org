<p>Kinda late, I know. You've probably seen all these, but particularly interesting to me is the Erlang link. Since I first linked to that Erlang code I've dived deep into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29">Erlang</a> and wrote my first few apps running inside <a href="http://yaws.hyber.org/">YAWS</a>, the super-fast Erlang server.</p>

<p>A quote from this <a href="http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html">performance article</a>: "Apache dies at about 4,000 parallel sessions. Yaws is still functioning at over <em>80,000</em> parallel connections." That's Apache <em>with</em> the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/worker.html">MPM Worker</a> installed.</p>

<p>Makes sense a language and framework developed for large scale, distributed, lightning-fast telecom systems would find its way to web apps. Erlang, erlang, erlang! It's everywhere!</p>
