<li><strong>Dan Hon’s</strong> “<a href="http://tinyletter.com/danhon">Things That Have Caught My Attention</a>” This is a daily email that reads like it spilled out of Dan’s head as he was writing it. Full of good thoughts on stuff. I like stuff. Especially all the stuff Dan writes about.</li>
<li><strong>Dave Pell’s</strong> “<a href="http://nextdraft.com/">NextDraft</a>” Dave has been doing this for a few years now. It’s 100% links you want to click. The writing is smart and funny. Beware: the subject lines are the most effective subject lines in the history of email.</li>
<li><strong>Ann Friedman’s</strong> “<a href="http://tinyletter.com/annfriedman">The Ann Friedman Weekly</a>” Though only weekly, I just love the dense block of links that are full of interesting things to read. I don’t even know how I found this but I am glad I did.</li>
<li><strong>Rusty Foster’s</strong> “<a href="http://tinyletter.com/todayintabs">Today in Tabs</a>” I laugh out loud when I read this email. I LOL.</li>
