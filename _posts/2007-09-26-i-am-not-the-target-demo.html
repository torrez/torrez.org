<p>Tomorrow is my birthday. I will be 35. Good bye 18-34, hello 35-I don't even know what&mdash;something old. </p>

<p>In my final act as a member of the coveted 18-34 year old demographic I have a small confession to make: I stayed up an extra 30 minutes last night so I could find a pair of shoes my skater wears in a video game I'm playing.</p>

<p>(By the way, <a href="http://store.caliskatz.com/browseproducts/Osiris-Shoes-247-Black-Rasta.html">I found them</a>, but they're sold out. I'm going to be so proud the day my kids find this post.)</p>
