title: Dropcash XML Parser
---
<p>
This is cool: a simple PHP parser for Dropcash's XML feed. <a href="http://www.merseine.com/dropcash.html">Dropcash Parser</a> written by Matt Warren lets you display your Dropcash campaigns in any manner you wish.

<p>
Also, and I bet this wasn't obvious to people, but you can set up your own Dropcash page by copying the &lt;form&gt; tags and placing them on your own site. Keep the IPN information in-tact and PayPal will continue to ping the correct server. Change the "thank you" page variable to your own page and now nobody will even know you are running a Dropcash campaign.
