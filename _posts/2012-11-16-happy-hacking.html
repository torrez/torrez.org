<p>For my birthday a couple of weeks ago my friend Omar gave me a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>. I’d been aware of them <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2011/12/little-linux-home-server-appliance.html">since in 2011</a>, but I never got around to buying one.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef017c339b8a8c970b-pi" alt="ID859 LRG" title="ID859_LRG.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="230" /></p>

<p>I’ve been toying with it the past few nights as I have had time. After <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/998">buying the case above</a>, I had to scrounge up a USB keyboard, then an SD card, then a monitor I could use that took HDMI input. At every turn it was some piece of tech I had discarded or at some point put away in a box. I didn’t even have an extra micro-USB cable so I am using the one that came with my Kindle.</p>

<p>But now that it is running I have fallen in love with this little computer. It is one of those things you think you understand until you actually get one in your hands and powered up.</p>

<p>Now I can play with these little ideas I’ve had, on a computer in my house, that didn’t cost $1,000, and only pennies to keep running 24/7. These are small ideas: a little <a href="http://www.theobvious.com/archive/1999/12/27.html">Spyonit app</a> I’ve been wanting but didn’t feel like paying an EC2 instance for, a big Twitter API idea that I have been toying with that will simply publish static pages to S3, and another idea I had about coordinating backups.</p>

<p>There is something indescribably pleasing about this thing. It feels like the time when I owned computers purely for fun. (And at 512Mb it has even more RAM than those computers.)</p>
