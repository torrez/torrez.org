<p>As I backed out I raised my hand to push the button on the garage door remote. The homeless man who had been laying next to our garage thought I was waving at him and he gave a small wave back. Instinctively my hand, still raised after pushing the button, gave him a wave. It was a long wave. Longer than was called for and with a familiarity I would reserve for a friend. And he, looking uncomfortable with the realization of what was happening, gave a second wave back to me. By then I had backed out as far as I needed and turned my attention to the road.</p>
