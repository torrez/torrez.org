<p>Yesterday <a href="http://berglondon.com/">Berg</a> announced two products, <a href="http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/">The Little Printer</a> and <a href="http://bergcloud.com/">Berg Cloud</a>. Everyone was pretty excited about this little printer. It’s so damn cute!</p>

<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/32796535?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/32796535">Hello Little Printer, available 2012</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/bergstudio">BERG</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>But the really cool thing here is Berg Cloud. Well, potentially cool, since we’ve just seen video of it. But together they make me, a developer and lover of small, cute things, really excited. So excited that I checked out the price of thermal printers and found out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JVX13U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003JVX13U">they are staggeringly expensive</a>.</p>

<p>But then I remembered I <em>already</em> own a thermal printer. A cheap one that prints labels. So I researched a little more and figured out how one could have their own thermal printer to hack away on:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027JBLV4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0027JBLV4">Buy a Dymo LabelWriter</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z5Q2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andretorrez-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004Z5Q2">Buy this continuous thermal paper</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://developers.dymo.com/2011/11/17/javascript-library-samples-printers-and-multiple-labels-printing/">Use the Dymo JavaScript SDK</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not as cute as the Little Printer, but appears to do the printing part of the equation. Mine prints pretty detailed stamps, so I think it should handle graphics like the ones that were in the demo. I haven’t gotten my hands on the continuous thermal paper yet, so I can’t say if the SDK will give as much control over printing, but it seems like a fun project if you’re looking for one.</p>
