<p>Throw this on the "if I had more time" pile: <a href="http://www.sfmta.com/cms/rdlymuni/dlymuniindx.php">SF Muni Service Delivery Daily Reports</a>. PDFs of the days events like accidents, number of trains through different lines, people transfered out of the game, how many people didn't show up for work so far this month, or a stop for "OPERATOR PERSONAL NECESSITY".</p>
