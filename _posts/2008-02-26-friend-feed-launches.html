<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> is finally public. It aggregates all your friend's feeds and your feeds into one lovely river of feed goodness. I like it. Here's <a href="http://friendfeed.com/torrez">mine</a>, let's be friends!</p>

<p>Someone is going to accidentally put the output into the input of one of these many feed aggregation/repurposing sites and blow up the Internet. Just watch.</p>
