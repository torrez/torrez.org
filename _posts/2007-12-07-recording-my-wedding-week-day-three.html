<p>I'm kind of beat tonight. We did a lot of running around today ending up in Pasadena for the wedding tomorrow. Our rehearsal was pretty simple and the dinner was very good. I've been really tired from sleeping on a futon the past couple of nights so I'm looking forward to getting a good night's sleep. </p>

<p>Amber has been a force this past week. She's been in complete command of the schedule, completely together, always on time, and operating at a frequency I had not seen before. I get the feeling all this wedding stuff is really just a trial by fire invented to expose all the nerves to see what we're both really made of. </p>

<p>I have never admired Amber more than this moment right now. </p>

<p>Everyone keeps asking me if I'm nervous. I'm not. My only anxiety comes from hoping our guests enjoy themselves and people don't leave too early. Everyone tells me the night will go by so fast and I hope it doesn't.</p>

<p>My parents are in the other room of their suite. I'm staying with them since they rented such a big place and my dad is going to cut my hair in the morning. We're separated by a very thin door so I can hear my dad getting his nightly dose of The O'Reilly Factor and I can feel my mom silently cheering for Obama every time his name is mentioned. </p>

<p>Completely true: Earlier tonight I had pointed out to them my wedding ring doesn't fit, my fingers have gotten too fat since I was sized. My mom just whispered to my dad, "I could tell he (me) gained weight." I yelled out, "I can hear you!" and she snapped back, "I thought you said you were wearing earplugs!" and I said, "Only when I sleep!" and then I swear she whispered softer to him, "I could tell."</p>

<p>I'm editing this thing too much. I should just go to sleep. I don't think I'm going to be able to write again soon, so I saved the details of our wedding to post after the wedding. I'm a very happy guy right now.</p>
