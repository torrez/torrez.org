In a week where Jason <a href="http://q.queso.com/archives/001725">brought to light a storm</a> over AJAX on Wikipedia, I had a run-in with a particularly nasty Wikipedian who is HELL BENT on preserving an entry he knows nothing about. He's reverted versions of an entry that make no sense, purely because people are voting its deletion. He's like some sort of attack dog switched to "on" position and I doubt he'll give up without giving it his best.

I stupidly stuck my foot in the conversation when I should have just let it be. It's amazing how easy it is to get drawn into that machine, when all you want to do is correct a few nasty and incorrect assertions. It's a world I need to just experience from the outside.

Kind of like visiting a slaughterhouse, it's best just not to know.
