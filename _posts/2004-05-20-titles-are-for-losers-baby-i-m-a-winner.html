<li>Oh shit! <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/purchase.html" title="money grubbers!">Time to switch to Wordpress!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.deuceofclubs.com/randumb/unimaginative_city_names/index.html">The Site of Unimaginative City Names</a> - I don't know if "City of Industry, Ca" and "City of Commerce, CA" are clever or unimaginative. Going to City of Industry feels a lot like how the early settlers of Greenland probably felt.</li>
<li>One of my favorite time wasting things to do is search Google for phrases people overuse. Andy linked <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22except+country+%2Band+rap%22+OR+%22except+rap+%2Band+country%22">rap and country</a> today (usually preceeded by, "I love all music...")</li>
<li>Whenever I see a job that mentions "401k" my brain thinks it's a salary. There are so few $401,000 a year jobs these days.</li>
<li>Anil <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/05/19/moving_forward">is moving to San Francisco</a>. He says a lot of the things I wish I could say.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.yellow5.com/pokey/">Pokey The Penguin</a> used to be the #1 online comic strip on the Internet. He says a lot of the things I wish I could say.</li>
