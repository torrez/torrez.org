<p>I've updated the <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/about.html">about page</a>. One of Typepad's useful features is the ability to publish pages. I know lots of blogging tools have had it for a while, I just never used it. I think I'm going to try and do more larger articles on them. I have an <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> starter page I've been wanting to do.</p>
