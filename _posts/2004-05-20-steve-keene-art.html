Remember when you were a kid and you'd put 25Â¢ into one of those toy machines and get a bubble of plastic containing a toy? <a href="http://www.stevekeene.com/home.html">Steve Keene Art</a> is kind of like that. Except they're $8 each and you have to wait a week or so to get it. He paints all day and then ships his work out to whoever buys.

I just got my delivery and I'm..well.. they're very pink. Very pink. I am not big on pink. But that's the way it works. You might or might not like it, take your chances.
