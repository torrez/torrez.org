Day four and <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2006/06/bad_software.html">no word</a> from <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/news/">Ambrosia Software</a> even though they asked me to mail them about the error. I totally understand their silence, I mean, I am not giving them money why should they expend the energy to help me? I'm only uninstalling Snapz Pro X because it nagged me every morning and spontaneously throughout the day even though I wasn't using the product. It also kept track of some imaginary number of times I used it even though I only used it once to actually record something and three other times to see what other features it had.

I found how to uninstall <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/support/faqs/faq.php?forum=75&title=Snapz%20Pro%20X&version=2.0.2&link=utilities/snapzprox/#161">in their online FAQ</a> and since that didn't come up in Google when I searched I will provide it here for those Googling.

<p>
Also, I will provide you with a link to an awfully named product that seems to work okay so far. <a href="http://shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html">iShowU</a>. Heh.
