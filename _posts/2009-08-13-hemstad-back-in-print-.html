<p>I cannot turn down a happy song with a fast beat. A few years ago <a href="http://www.catbirdrecords.com/">Catbird Records</a> released an album from a band called Hemstad who were from Sweden. It was so good! And then they sold out. The album, that is, I don't know what happened to the band. (What happened to the band?)</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://catbirdrecords.com/cbr_003.shtml">the CD is back on sale</a> so get it.</p>
