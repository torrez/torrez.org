<p>So not only does <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2012/03/build-this-a-new-kind-of-review-site.html">my little idea</a> exist, but they’ve solved some of the problems I thought I’d have dealing with films a user hasn’t seen. <a href="http://flickchart.com/">Flickchart</a> takes a <a href="http://hotornot.com/">Hot Or Not</a> approach to rating movies, and gives you a way to skip movies you haven’t seen.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing with it for an hour or so and it seems to be building a pretty good profile of the movies I like and don’t like. Check it out: <a href="http://flickchart.com/">http://flickchart.com</a>.</p>
