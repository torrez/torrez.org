I was seriously addicted to <a href="">Encyclopedia Brown</a> stories when I was a kid. Someone brought up the books on a discussion board, and I was amazed that I could still remember the ending explanations.
</p>
<p>
"How can he know the knife was short if it was still buried in the watermelon?"
</p>
<p>
"He was punched in the chest yet he put his glasses on right after the bully ran away!"
</p>
<p>
"The happy baby is dancing on a hot car hood that was just driven for hours."
</p>
<p>
"The guitarist without pads on the tips of his fingers is the fake. Guitarists develop calluses on the tips of their fingers after years of playing."
</p>
<p>
Were you a fan, and can you still remember the endings?
