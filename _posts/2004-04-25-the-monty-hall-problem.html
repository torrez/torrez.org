Jason linked <a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~crypto/Monty/montybg.html">The Monty Hall Problem</a> in his <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/04/04/index.html">remaindered links</a>, and it reminded me that I made a <a href="http://www.torrez.net/projects/MakeADeal/">web version of the problem</a> for kicks.

It's a bit like <a href="http://www.phobe.com/s_cat/s_cat.html">actually putting a cat in a box</a> with some cyanide gas, but without the mess.
