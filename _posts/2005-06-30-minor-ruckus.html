<p>My friend <a href="http://www.honan.net/emptyage.php">Mat</a> and I talked a bit this morning about the <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/06/theft-or-homage">Minor Threat / Major Threat</a> ruckus going on right now. He called me cynical for equating it with some t-shirt vendor selling a shirt with &quot;McPothead&quot; written on it in a McDonald's font.</p>

<p>I'm not going to get into any debates about what punk is or isn't, that's for whoever to decide on their own. I just think that caring about imagery so much as to create a lifestyle around it is falling in the same trap so many people rebelled against a few years ago. Treating your beliefs like a pair of Jordache jeans is what they want you to do.</p>

<p>I love the remix culture, and I will try to consistently support it when I see it.<br /></p>
