<p>I love this piece of marketing from Burger King: <a href="http://www.sogoodblog.com/2009/01/07/whopper-sacrifice-ditch-10-friends-get-a-free-whopper/">Whopper Sacrifice</a>. You use the Facebook App to "sacrifice" 10 friends by un-friending them, and you then get a coupon for a free Whopper.  Those friends receive messages stating they were unfriended by their former friend and a chance to install the app and get a burger for themselves.</p>

<p>People I know who are using it are dumping friends for the burger but will likely re-friend them later which is just perfect. Good stuff. </p>
