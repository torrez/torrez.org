<p>Can we get over the teeth gnashing when a song we like from an artist we love shows up in a commercial? <a href="http://adblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/08/28/330122.aspx">MSNBC's Adblog flips its wig</a> (go me!) over the inclusion of "See A Little Light" in a <a href="http://www.tiaa-cref.org/powerof.org/gallery1.html?tc_lnk=rightnav">tiaa-cref.org commercial</a>. </p>

<p>Bob Mould himself is second to comment on the weblog that he made a "leap of faith that they are least likely to be quietly investing in unseemly causes". If it's good enough for Bob Mould it's good enough for me. </p>

<p>It seems like the mp3 free music revolution is being a little hypocritical in forcing artists to rethink how they go about making money from their music but then requiring them to live by the old standards where you can't get your art dirty by allowing a company to license it.</p>
