My friend Michael who runs <a href="http://news.wordphoto.org/2004/11/wordphoto_needs.html">Wordphoto</a> sent out a request for help in keeping wordphoto alive (bandwidth probs!) and his request <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/campaign/michaelbuffington/wordphoto_server/">was answered</a>.
</p>
<p>
Even more impressive is this <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/campaign/acurazine/holiday_toy_drive/">Toy Drive</a> being held by <a href="http://www.acurazine.com/">AcuraZine</a>. $5,000 worth of Matchbox cars is an awesome idea for a gift, I pitched in a couple of dollars, why don't you?
</p>
<p>
Speaking of pitching in, I realized today while looking over the database, I've handed out nearly $200 in testing and helping people get their campaigns rolling. It boggles my mind sometimes when I think about the free sites and the time I spend working on them, and I still haven't managed to get any of them to turn a profit. It's like I'm not even trying.
