Macs are such a huge part of my life, I can’t imagine where I’d be without them. I’ve spent thousands of hours installing new applications, customizing icons, designing and abandoning workflows, trying new utilities, widgets and gadgets and generally just using the hell out of Macs and OS X.

Garrett Murray has replaced <a href="http://prettifyit.com/">Prettify</a> with a new site called <a href="http://usefulmac.com/">Useful Mac</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/usefulmac">@usefulmac</a>). A site dedicated to Macintosh computers; featuring interesting apps, reviews, wallpapers, and icons. Definitely worth bookmarking. I love my Macs.
