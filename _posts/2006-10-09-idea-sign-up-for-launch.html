Dear Lazyweb, someone make a site called "Sign Up For Launch" or something where all the web2.0 sites that are "coming soon" just link to one site where you can sign up to be notified at any and all of them, browse others, and then ultimately, when one of these web2.0 sites you sign up for actually launches you can get a notification email.
</p><p>
Two wins here,
</p><ol><li>I get to find out about all the sites people are working on without having to constantly check Chris Messina's Flickr stream</li><li>People who are working on sites can spend time working on the sites and not building yet another "coming soon" form that yellow fades into stars which then lightbox and explode into rounded cornered gradient spooge</li></ol><p>
Or someone just make me some javascript that does item #2 above. Yay.
