<p>I keep wanting to post about <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/nutshell-20">Kindle</a> but everyone else has <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/19/the-future-of-reading">done it better</a> (ob. link to Mark Pilgrim's post).</p>

<p>Instead I will just comment that ebook readers: awesome. Wireless EVDO enabled ebook readers that can download a specially formatted version of the NY Times or other newspaper: awesome. An actual selection of books to buy: way awesome. </p>

<p>I own a Sony eBook Reader. It sits in a drawer underneath my Sony PSP. The reason it's in the drawer is I read every book I wanted to read on <a href="http://manybooks.net/">manybooks.net</a> and Sony's online book store selection was terrible (I think there were four tech books). After some noodling I was able to set up a workflow for converting <s>pirated</s> found txt formatted books or free books like <a href="http://craphound.com/index.php?cat=5">Cory's library</a>. </p>

<p>The ebook itself, the e-ink never loses its cool. If you have been wanting an ebook I say buy it. I think this has more to do with Amazon's lack of experience with developing and shipping electronic products than people will admit. But I'm biased: I like gadgets and things that are awesome.</p>
