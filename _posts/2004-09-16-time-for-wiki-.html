title: Time For Wiki

<p>
Most of you won't know what a Wiki is, and even more of you probably won't
ever find out.
</p>
<p>
A Wiki is, in the simplest terms, a web application for organizing documents that is
usually open for editing by all.
You can <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BriefIntro">start here</a> if you want to learn more
about them.
There are various Wikis written in everything from PHP to Ruby to PERL. After
installing many Wikis over the years, I finally feel like I found one that is
very nearly perfect for my personal notets. I say "nearly" because it's still
sub 1.0 and has a few important features to be added.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.instiki.org/">Instiki</a> is written in Ruby and shares the simplicity of that language. It also
includes <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> formatting
which makes teaching someone how to mark-up pages a breeze.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.instiki.org/">Instiki</a> seems to pride itself on the "there's no third step" simplicity of
installation, and it's true. I was able to get it running on my Mac, Linux,
and FreeBSD machines in only two steps (download, run script). I customized it
further by running it through ProxyPass in Apache so I get nice clean URLs, but
that's not necessary, it's just nice.

<p>
If you had considered using Wikis before, but couldn't get past the installation
or the odd formatting requirements, I suggest you check out <a href="http://www.instiki.org/">Instiki</a>.
