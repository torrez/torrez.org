By coincidence I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000065U1N/qid=1109188171/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-8472568-8560019?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846">Black Hawk Down</a> last night, followed by a Frontline episode titled <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/company/">A Company Of Soldiers</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Frontline episode, incidentally, is <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=televisionNews&storyID=2005-02-22T225743Z_01_N22544650_RTRIDST_0_TELEVISION-MEDIA-FRONTLINE-DC.XML">causing some commotion</a> over the 13 expletives the soldiers utter during the filming. For all the violence and senseless dog killing, saying "goddamn" after an unarmed citizen (who at the time is writhing in the back seat of his car) is killed by a ricochet is a big no-no.

My local PBS station ran the censored version, which was surprising considering the article says the LA affiliate was going to run it. I'm wondering if DirecTV requested a different feed or KCET flaked at the last moment.
