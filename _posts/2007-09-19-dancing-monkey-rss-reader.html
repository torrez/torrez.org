<p>I would like an RSS reader with a button that says "Gimme 5" and it loads only five posts people with similar subscriptions are reading within the last 24 hours. Then as I read each one, they disappear so that I once again have a blank inbox which I can click "Gimme 5" or just go on to do something else.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm inventing a little treat dispenser, but dammit I need portions.</p>
