Oh I love stuff like this. I was looking at some old <a href="http://blackhorse.dartmouth.edu/dcompany/Photo%20gallery_1968.htm">photos of Vietnam</a> and came across a few of <a href="http://blackhorse.dartmouth.edu/dcompany/images/102.jpg">John Van Nus</a>. I thought, "I wonder what happened to that guy," and immediately went to Google with his name and found some pictures of <a href="http://www.ktroop.com/cc_van_nus.htm">Mr. Van Nus</a> (and <a href="http://www.ktroop.com/images/cc/van_nus_patton_internment_04.jpg">Alexander "I'm in control here!" Haig</a>) from less than two months ago.
