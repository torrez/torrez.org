[Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) blends the best parts of hosted content management systems and static site generators to make a CMS that would be worth checking out if you've spent any time trying to make a static site generator work.

The [intro video](https://vimeo.com/169542999) explains it all pretty well. I use and like Jekyll, but watching that video reminds me of features I would really like to have someday. At $7 a month it'd be well worth the cost if you have a lot to publish (I don't).
