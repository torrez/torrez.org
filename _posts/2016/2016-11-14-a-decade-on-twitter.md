[A Decade on Twitter](https://adactio.com/journal/11436) by Jeremy Keith.

I too hit my 10 year mark on Twitter this month. After last week I stepped away from Twitter with no real goal other than to get some distance for a bit.

So far it's been pretty nice. On the few occasions I've gone back to read a funny tweet or see a photo, nothing has changed for me. Twitter hasn't even changed. It's just not something I want to spend time on right now.

So I'm not saying I'm off Twitter for good, but I am just on a break and we'll see how that goes.
