I listened to Warren Zevon's "Werewolves of London" around 70 times today. Sometimes when I need to focus I throw a single song into a playlist and let it roll for eight hours until it's time to go home.

It feels good to know what's coming up next and I sort of zen out on the repetition. The longer I listen, the more stuff I notice about a song. The way the bassist switches to double-time after the bridge. The way drums seem to get hotter after a guitar solo. After 70+ listens the decisions by whoever produced and mixed the song end up revealing themselves in ways I just didn't notice before.

But also I notice the little rough edges. They're usually buried in the mix. Something like a stray finger on a string or finger squeak. Sometimes it's a singer coming in too early. Usually it isn't as glaring as Kurt Cobain jumping in too early on "Polly Says", but a minor thing that finds its way into the mix for me to notice by the 20th straight listen.

After hearing a song 70+ times in a row those little imperfections become familiar moments like a good opening lyric or drum fill. They grow and stick out like a bump.

Werewolves of London has one. It happens after the last verse, after the word "perfect". See if you can spot it:

It's a tiny yelp before going into the chorus. I've thought about what it could be and at some point today I think I decided it was a clipped "Ah-whooo" from the chorus that they decided to move back a measure.

Maybe? I don't know. It seems like one of those things that got missed and went unnoticed through the hiss and pop of car stereos. Or maybe nobody actually listened to it 70+ times in a row
