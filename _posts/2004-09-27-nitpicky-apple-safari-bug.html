Probably nitpicking, but I just noticed that when I mouse over the built-in Google search box in Safari I get a poorly worded (?) tool-tip.

A couple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22type+a+word+of+phrase,+then+press+return%22&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">other people</a> noticed it too. That seems like a pretty big bug to just miss.
