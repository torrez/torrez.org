<p>About 13 years ago I wrote an application called XuMouse.</p>

<p>This is what it looked like on Windows 98.</p>

<p>And here is what it looks like now.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef0176171a0a4f970c-pi" alt="NewImage" title="Now.png" border="0" width="293" height="160" /></p>

<p>Damn thing still works. Looks the same. Still doing what it does. FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. (Thank you, Microsoft Windows backward compatibility team.)</p>

<p>Every couple of months I get an email or phone call asking for a new copy. It seems that a lot of people run applications from their desktop or from the original archived file rather than installing it, so I point them to the correct URL or mail them the file. I keep meaning to make a new landing page for it but even when I did have one the email and calls still arrived.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, of the people who contact me are elderly. I believe many of them use the application to play games like online slot machines. It’s why I originally wrote the thing, there was a web site that gave you credits for pulling a slot machine lever and I thought it’d be funny to get a million credits. (I did. They were useless.)</p>

<p>The zip file, <a href="http://torrez.org/static/files/XuMouse.zip">which you can download here</a>, contained a README that asked for an email to tell me you were using it and say thank you. Many of the emails I receive are just to say thanks.</p>

<p>The app was free. I never considered charging for it because it literally took one night and maybe 10 lines of code. The zipped file is 7k and relied heavily on Microsoft’s MFC framework.</p>

<p>Something I barely remember doing 13 years ago for free still manages to cheer me up when I someone comes asking about it. That’s sort of all I really wanted out of that project.</p>
