title: guitar hero for ds (sorta)

<p>Probably due to the success of "Guitar Hero" UBISoft has licensed the Japan game "Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06" and <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001878.php">renamed it "Jam Sessions"</a>. I've had the Japanese version for almost half a year now, and it was always a challenge to play because the menus are in Japanese and it was tough to play along to popular Japanese songs I had never heard before.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ds/puzzle/jamsessions/news.html">But it sounds like they did a good job</a>, licensed some interesting songs (Nirvana, Death Cab for Cutie, Blind Melon, Coldplay, and Bob Marley) and added a few new features (though it's possible I just never found those features due to the language barrier).</p>
