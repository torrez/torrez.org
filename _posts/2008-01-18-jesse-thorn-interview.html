<p><a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">The Sound of Young America</a> is my favorite podcast. Not one of, <strong>is</strong>. I love the variety of guests and the questions always seem fresh even when the subjects are not. He didn't earn the title "America's Radio Sweetheart" for nothing.</p>

<p>One of my favorite interviews he did was with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Berman">Shelley Berman</a>. A legend with a history peppered with land-mines other interviewers would likely trod upon, yet Jesse managed to keep the interview interesting and coax a bit more than you'd expect from Shelley.</p>

<p>Here's Jesse, the host of TSoYA, <a href="http://www.zulkey.com/2008/01/the_jesse_thorn_interview.php">being interviewed by the also awesome Claire Zulkey</a>. </p>
