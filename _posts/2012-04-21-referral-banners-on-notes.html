<p>Happy Notes now has banners on the left side of the page. You might remember I had this idea <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2012/04/ad-network-idea.html">a couple weeks ago</a>. Before I throw them on MLKSHK I am going to get the bugs out of the admin by serving them here. (You’ll have to visit <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/">Notes</a> to see them.)</p>

<p>These aren’t exactly ads. I don’t intend on them only having links out to products you can buy. On MLKSHK I hope to be able to use them for serving content people want and links to things I think are worth seeing.</p>

<p>There are enough ad networks out there serving typical ads. I want to do something different.</p>

<p>More later!</p>
