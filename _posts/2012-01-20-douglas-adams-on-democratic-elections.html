<p>In light of the GOP debates this past week someone linked to this excerpt of the fourth book in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy trilogy but I have forgotten who it was. It’s the sort of thing you need to read in its entirety so I am not going to quote it. <a href="http://wso.williams.edu/~rcarson/lizards.html">Just go read</a>.</p>
