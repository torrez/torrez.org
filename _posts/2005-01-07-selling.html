I guess I'm releasing <a href="http://www.simpleform.com/TKPal/">TKPal</a> tonight. Though I think it still needs work. Anyone interested in testing it is invited to download the files and have a go with it. I don't think it works exactly how I want it to, but I could probably spend some time tweaking it and not get it right. I really should streamline it a bit more.

Anyway, if it doesn't make sense to you, ignore it. It's just some code that allows you to sell portions of your web pages using TypeKey and PayPal. Most people won't have the requirements to install it on their computer, but those that do now have a little head start in implementing a system for doing that. Or at least an example of how one was done.

I don't really have any other way of releasing something like this for testing purposes, but that's what this is for now. I wouldn't implement this on your server&nbsp; yet.
