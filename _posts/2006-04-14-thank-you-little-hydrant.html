When I first read that story a few months ago (1906 earthquake lore has been plentiful) I remember thinking how cool it was to live
in a city with so much visible history. After Amber and I went to Italy and saw, <a href="http://www.torrez.org/images/like.jpg">like</a>,
really old shit, coming back to Los Angeles was a bit of a let down.

bake in traffic, dodge a homeless person's shopping cart—and touch, but it's nice to be coming up that hill on Muni and just happen
to see something that played a huge part in the history of the neighborhood and the city.
