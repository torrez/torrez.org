I had another idea for a site, this one's called <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/">DropCash</a> and it was really a group effort. First, <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Jason</a> designed the pages and did a lot of the thinking about how to present the screens and information to people so it made sense. Then I implemented the <a href="http://www.typekey.com/">TypeKey</a> authentication service so people wouldn't have to remember ANOTHER password/email/user combo (and I wouldn't have to build one). And finally it all rides on top of the excellent <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> API.

<p>
I usually build sites by myself and then open them up for people to comment on them, but this time I tried to spread the work out as much as possible and I'm much happier with the result. I didn't let the project die on my hard-drive like so many other ideas I have.

If you'd like to see a better demonstration of how DropCash does its thing, head over to <a href="http://gominosensei.org/2004/08/armchair-quarterback-dropcash.php">Gominosensei</a>'s site for a more detailed explanation.

Finally, and I'm not joking, here is what is being said about DropCash in <a href="http://mena.typepad.com/photos/sixaparty/geek_talk.html">this picture</a>:<br />
Me: "I can't figure out why nobody had done this yet."<br />
Jeffrey: "So will you make any money?"<br />
Me: "No."<br />
Jeffrey: "That's why."<br />
