<p>
This song by <a href="http://www.neilcleary.com/">Neil Cleary</a> called "<a href="http://torrez.org/media/mp3/Neil%20Cleary%20-%20When%20All%20of%20Us%20Get%20Famous.mp3">When All Of Us Get Famous</a>" makes me a little sentimental. I'm no musician, but as a web tinkerer with aspirations of doing something grand, I can relate to what he's singing about.

Neil links this song on his site, so I think I'm okay offering it up. Please <a href="http://www.neilcleary.com/buy.html">buy the album</a>.
