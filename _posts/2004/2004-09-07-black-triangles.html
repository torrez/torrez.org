This story about <a href="http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/flying_triangle_040902.html">Black Triangle sightings</a> reminded me of the late 80's when people were talking about this new fighter plane that we later found out was the F-117 Stealth Fighter. It hadn't been publicly shown, and there were many reports of people spotting these planes doing all sorts of weird things in the air.
</p>
<p>
It turned out my town was under the flight path of the Stealth Fighter as it supposedly flew between Edwards AFB and Nellis AFB, and I remember seeing them float past our back yard just a few thousand (?) feet in the air. I can't really judge the distance of planes, but through the lens of my camcorder I remember being able to see them quite clearly.

One day of the planes that sticks out the most was when something like 20 of them (or was it just a couple screwing with us?) flew over our town in a stream, about one every 2 minutes. From the south you'd see them drop from the sky just as they entered the city limits, and then slowly float the length of the town, dragging a small hum of a jet engine behind them. Once they reached county line road, they'd head up into the clouds and disappear.

A few months after that day one crashed in the Tehachapi mountains outside of Bakersfield, and more information began to leak out about the planes. When the military finally released photos and information it was obvious what we had been seeing. Since then I've seen a couple of F-117's fly over sporting events&#8212;but it really never compares to the day when I saw them and they were unidentifiable and unconfirmed.
