Annoyed by my local Carl's Jr. drive-thru giving me a <strong>BBQ Chicken Sandwich</strong> instead of the Six-Dollar Burger I ordered, I wrote them an email. The response was:
</p>
<p>
"I assure you that every effort is being made to correct this situation.  I have contacted the District Manager regarding your experience."<br />
Okay, that's nice of you...
</p>

"I would like to invite you to give us one more chance, on us!  I am mailing you some Second Chance coupons good for either a free Famous Star Hamburger or a <strong>BBQ Chicken Sandwich</strong>.  I know there is really nothing that can excuse or make up for the situation you described, but we would love the chance to regain your trust."
