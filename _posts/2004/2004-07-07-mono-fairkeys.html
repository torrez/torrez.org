title: Mono FairKeys

<p>
<a href="http://www.waxy.org/">Andy points</a> to a program called <a href="http://nanocrew.net/blog/apple/fairkeys.html">FairKeys</a> which is used to return your FairPlay keys from the Apple server. </p>

Pretty cool, but what's also cool is that Jon wrote it in C# which, because of the recent release of <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>, means I can compile and run this thing thing on my Mac. I played with Mono a few days ago and was able to compile nearly all my classes that I had written previously to jumping to the Mac.
