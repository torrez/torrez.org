My friend Brian just launched a new site called <a href="http://www.poetc.com/">Poetc</a> that gives you two minutes to add a line to the current poem every day. Like his other site, <a href="http://www.oneword.com/">oneword</a>, it uses MovableType's comments to provide a daily piece of content for people to respond to.
