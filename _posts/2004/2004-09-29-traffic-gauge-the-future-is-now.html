One of the difficult things about leaving for work in the morning is making the choice between the 605 and the 405&mdash;as well as knowing if a slowdown is going to take 5 minutes or 30. If you drive in LA for any length of time you know there are phantom slowdowns that make you feel like you got ripped-off as there is no burning wreckage or dancing penguins at the end of it.

Having the ability to route around a problem on a map, either via surface streets or a different freeway, is much easier than trying to catch the traffic reports.
