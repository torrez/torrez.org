I took the Pixies' <em>Trompe le Monde</em> on my trip to visit my parents this weekend. It's one of my favorite albums of theirs and has the most aggressive stretch of Pixies (tracks 2-6) I can think of. Great mountain driving music.

Their cover of JAMC's "Head On" is always perplexing to me. It's a good cover and a great lead into "UMass"<sup>*</sup>, but it always seemed like a strange choice for the Pixies considering it was such a 'hit' for JAMC.

I was surprised to see that The Jesus & Mary Chain's albums were all imports on Amazon&#8212;"out of print in the U.S.". For a few years all I ever listened to was <em>Barbed Wire Kisses</em>, <em>Darklands</em>, and <em>Psychocandy</em> on cassette, and when I made the jump to CDs I could only afford <em>Psychocandy</em>. I never thought those albums would fall out of print when you consider influences keep popping up this many years after.
