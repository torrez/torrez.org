<p>
For those of you finding my page by searching Google for "gmail" and then coming here and asking me to "invite you into gmail" (it ain't Friendster), I have a site for you. It's called <a href="http://www.gmailswap.com/">GMail Swap</a> and unlike the crass selling of invites on Ebay, this seems harmless and feels like it fits within the spirit of inviting a friend.
