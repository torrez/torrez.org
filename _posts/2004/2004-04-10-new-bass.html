About two months ago, before <a href="http://www.thehoorays.com/">the band</a> broke up, I ordered a new bass. I had been using an old 1962 Fender Jazz Re-issue that sounded beautiful, but not really a rock guitar. It had a wonderful growl and resonance, but no punch. I needed a punch.

Last weekend it finally arrived, a special order through Guitar Center. I've been playing it every night as soon as I walk in the door. That cat hops up on the bass cabinet and purrs right along with the basslines.
