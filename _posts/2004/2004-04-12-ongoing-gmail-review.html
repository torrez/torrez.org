What I like about the beta version of <a href="https:/gmail.google.com/">gmail</a>:
    <ol>
        <li>The conversation format is an obvious natural evolution of email. I've seen a few mail clients attempt it through threading and grouping, but I've never seen it done as well as this.</li>
        <li>Secure server access. You can go to <a href="https://gmail.google.com/">https://gmail.google.com/</a> and conduct your session securely.</li>
        <li>Labels versus folders. Instead of making folders to hold individual messages (Did I put that message in the "Namco" folder or in the "System Admin" folder?) all messages live in your inbox and can be filtered by labels you assign or auto-assign to them.</li>
        <li>The key commands, are inspired by vi. I wasn't sure whether to put this on my like or dislike list, it's too fashionable to bash vi, so I'll put it here, it's cute. ("bash vi"...Unix jokes never die)</li>
        <li>Purely from a technical standpoint, I love the use of JavaScript to make this work more like an app and less like a web app. Or, as some have suggested, to thwart scripted automation from 3rd party clients. Either way, it's an impressive feat and I applaud anyone who attempts that kind of stuff.</li>
        <li>One gigabyte of saved email. That's incredible. At the very least set up a double forward to archive all your messages for easy searching later.</li>

    </ol>

What I dislike about beta version of <a href="https://gmail.google.com/">gmail</a>:
    <ol>
        <li style="text-decoration:line-through"><a style="text-decoration:line-through" href="http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/about.html#support" alt="item 6"><span style="text-decoration:line-through">No remote POP access. If I can't access my gmail from any web browser, then I should at least be able to do it from a POP client.</span></a></li>
        <li style="text-decoration:line-through"><a style="text-decoration:line-through" href="http://gmail.google.com/gmail/help/about.html#support" alt="item 6"><span style="text-decoration:line-through">No POP access from within gmail. I want to connect gmail to my other POP accounts.</span></a></li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration:line-through">I had to use andre.torrez@gmail.com because both 'andre' and 'torrez' were not available. I know this is a silly thing to complain about, but keee-rist you'd think the least I could get for being in on the beta is a super-hot vanity address.</span> Okay, someone explained to me that a spammer would just run through common names @gmail.com so they have a list that is not allowed. Makes sense.</li>
    </ol>

Weird moment using the beta version of <a href="https://gmail.google.com/">gmail</a>
    <ol>
          <li>Going to <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount">https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount</a> to manage my "account".</li>
   </ol>
<p>
I am sure I'll keep updating this as I find new things.
</p>
<p>
Update (04/23/04): It looks like GMail now works in Safari. Hooray.
