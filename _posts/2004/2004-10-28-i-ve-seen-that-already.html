I still do not have a proper response formulated for things people have forwarded me that I have already seen. In addition to running FilePile, I read blogs. Lots of them. I have over 200 subscriptions that I actively keep track of, so the chances of me seeing photos of Ron Jeremy seeing his first goatse are pretty high.

I don't want <a href="http://www.dashes.com/magazine/backissues/pardon_me_for_being_forward.php">to be rude about it</a>, but I just have no simple way of saying, "seen it" without feeling like a jerk every time.
