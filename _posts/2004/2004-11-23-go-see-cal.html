When you're a kid and you're watching TV, it's sometimes hard to distinguish between what is the entertainment and what is the commercial. <a href="http://www.mydogspot.com/scrapbook.htm">Cal Worthington Ford</a> "down in Long Beach" had the most entertaining and catchy spots of them all, and anyone who grew up in Southern California could finish the phrase, "If you need a car or truck..."

I bet there were Cal Worthington-type advertisements when you were growing up. I'd love to hear about them. <a href="http://atlanta.about.com/cs/celebrityprofiles/a/wolfman.htm">The Wolfman</a> in Atlanta? <a href="http://www.nbtw.com/">The Wiz</a> in New York?
