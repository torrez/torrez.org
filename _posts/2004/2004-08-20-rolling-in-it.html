Dear Andre Torrez, <br />
Thank you for referring Xxxxx Xxxxxxx to PayPal. Because
Xxxxx Xxxxxxx just signed up for a Premier or Business PayPal account, you
are now eligible to receive a Merchant Referral Bonus.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Xxxxx Xxxxxxx has used PayPal to receive a total of $200.00 USD in
payments, you will receive your initial bonus of $1.00 USD, which will be
deposited directly into your PayPal account
</p>

I did not know that. I think that's a little low. I'm not complaining, they could give 50Â¢ and I probably wouldn't care, but I think as an incentive that's not a very good one.
