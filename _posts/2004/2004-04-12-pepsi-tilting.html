Paul Ford's piece on <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/PepsiTilting.html">Pepsi Tilting</a> reminded me of the day I built my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_box">red box</a>.
</p>
<p>
A red box, for those of you not in the know is a device that allowed you to make free pay-phone calls. When a quarter was dropped into a pay-phone, five little tones were sent down the line to the central office telling them that a quarter was deposited (a dime is two tones, one tone equaled five cents). Through secret channels and <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/">text files</a> the instructions were passed along.
</p>
<p>
It was so simple to build and use that it was almost a joke. Since I was in college I'd build red boxes for anyone who wanted to give me the $10 it cost to make one. I think if a hack like that were to come out now, it'd be routed around within a year.
