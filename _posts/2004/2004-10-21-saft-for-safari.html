<p>
I just bought a copy of the Safari plugin <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/">Saft</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to ridding Safari of the brushed metal look, changing what the search box searches, and putting type-ahead searching in the browser, Saft will also restore all the windows you were viewing when Safari crashes. It also <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/Usage/index.html">does a lot more</a>.
</p>
<p>
$10 is cheap for this type of functionality. Plus the nag screen is annoying.
