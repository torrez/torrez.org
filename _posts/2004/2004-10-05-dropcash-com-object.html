title: Dropcash Com Object
---
<p>
<a href="http://www.getluky.com/">Gordon Luk</a> just released a COM object written in C# that allows you to <a href="http://www.getluky.net/projects/DropCash/">place a Dropcash campaign</a> in your Windows applications.
</p>
<p>
And if that's not cool enough, he's releasing the source code as soon as his <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/campaign/getluky/open_source_the_dropcash_com/">own campaign</a> is completed.
