I got caught up in the iTunes contest and ended up buying <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=6654642">an album</a> song-by-song during the 100,000,000 mark. Using <a href="http://ym.muda.org/itunes/">these</a> <a href="http://www.itunesdaily.com/countdown/index.php">two</a> sites as indicators of when it was going to happen.

I think I got close since my purchases were spread out during the 5 minute update interval. <a href="http://mac.honan.net/">Mat</a> pointed out that it was fortuitous that the switch happened on the eve of MacWorld where they could announce the 100,000,000 mark&#8212;as well as the 50,000 song sales sales in the span of about 10 minutes.
