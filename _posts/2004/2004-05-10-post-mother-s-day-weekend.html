title: Post Mother's Day Weekend
---
<p>
Saw my family this weekend. As you probably know Gmail handed out accounts for everyone's mother, but my mom uses Safari, so that didn't work like we had hoped. Mom discovered <strong>HTML email</strong>. Note to Gmail team:  Must. Get. Safari. Working. SOON!

<a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> re-launched. I logged into my old account to check out the features and was impressed with how well it is laid out. I'd say you can't compete with free, but that would be unfair to Blogger, free or not it's very well done. <a href="http://gominosensei.org/2004/05/blogger-wars.php">Me and Jason had some fun</a> talking about it this morning.

Nobody has mentioned that when the GMail team sends you an email, they reference Mr. McFeely from Mister Rogers by signing it: "Speedy Delivery!"
