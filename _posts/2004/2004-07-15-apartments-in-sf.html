<a href="http://www.fastbusy.com/">Fast Busy</a> does two very cool things. First it aggregates all the apartments posted to Craig's List, then it plots a graph showing volume versus price. <a href="http://www.fastbusy.com/aptdetail.php?location=haight%20ashbury&size=1">May in Haight Ashbury</a> seems like a good time to have looked for a place.
