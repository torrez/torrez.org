I just saw <a href="http://www.shellen.com/jason/archives/2004_04_01_default.asp#108155076336778542">Jason Shellen's</a> running tally of GMail reviews. He's got my torrez.org one linked on it but since I never use log analyzers I'd never know. Heh.

I just found out something gmail does that I didn't know it did: +addressing. Meaning I can make my own address (andre.torrez+example@gmail.com) and filter on the word "example". That's a big one.
