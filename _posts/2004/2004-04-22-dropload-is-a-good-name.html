What is <a href="http://www.langa.com/">Langalist</a>? Apparently <a href="http://www.dropload.com/">Dropload</a> got mentioned there and we just passed 23,000 users. We're listed under the heading "Bad Name, Good Idea". Hah! Pottle-kettle-black, Fred.

It's a little hard to get excited about new users when I know that it means more bandwidth and HD space and very little $. Um, no $. When did I become such a hippie?
