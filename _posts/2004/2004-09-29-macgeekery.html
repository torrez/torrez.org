<a href="http://www.macgeekery.com/">This is my kind of Mac site</a>. MacGeekery is a site for more advanced Macintosh tips and hacks with a moderated submission policy. <a href="http://www.macgeekery.com/node/6">Partitioning the iPod</a> turns out to be something I was looking for, and <a href="http://www.macgeekery.com/node/9">RAM Disks Made Easy</a> was something I didn't even know I wanted to learn about.
