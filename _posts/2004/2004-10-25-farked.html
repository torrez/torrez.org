It's been a while since I'd been farked. Through some coincidence I had called my ISP to fix a billing problem with my credit card, and I thought I'd find out how my bandwidth was doing. Since I'm a friend of theirs I think they give me a little bit of extra rope with this stuff, but we both couldn't believe what we were seeing when we saw my stats for the past day.

Anyway, if you're wondering why www.torrez.org is off, it's because I'm doing some cleaning up.
