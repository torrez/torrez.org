Ashley Simpson seems to have raised a ton of interest in another infamous SNL performance. A few years back <a href="http://torrez.org/archives/2002_06.php">I wrote about Elvis Costello</a> and the Attractions doing "Radio, Radio" on  SNL. When the Ashley Simpson thing happened the conversations in all the little PHPBB boards and Fark boards and Honda Acura Fan Site boards and secret file trading boards eventually turned to the subject of his performance, which lead to Google, which led them all to <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2004/10/farked.html">my little server</a>.

I'll put the video back up in a week or so, as soon as the Farkers move back to boobies.

If you can find the song "Radio, Radio" please have a listen.
