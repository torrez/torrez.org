title: RSS For Netflix

<p>
I knew this was going to be a good day. <br /><a href="http://www.netflix.com/RSSFeeds?lnkctr=mfRSS">Netflix releases RSS feeds</a>.
</p>
<p>
I think they should do more to educate people about RSS though. I think Blogger has done the best job at that with their <a href="http://www.evhead.com/atom.xml">styled Atom feeds</a>.
