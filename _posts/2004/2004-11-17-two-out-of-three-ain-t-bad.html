<p>
My cyber-internet-friend Gabriel Jeffrey has compiled a book from the <a href="http://grouphug.us/">grouphug.us</a> archives called <a href="http://gabrieljeffrey.com/snl/">Stoned, Naked, And Looking in My Neighbor's Window</a> for Simon & Schuster. It's a real live book you can go to your local store (or shoppe for those of you in the UK) and buy.

I like the UK cover more than the US one. Mainly because I like comics more than girls in panties.
