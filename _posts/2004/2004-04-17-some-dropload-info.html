title: Some Dropload Info
---
<p>
It seems that <a href="http://www.dropload.com/">Dropload</a> got mentioned somewhere big (I think <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/">Lockergnome</a> or a related <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris thing</a> since a few people needing tech support in the past couple of days have mentioned Chris having told them) and we're getting tons of new subscribers to the service.
</p>
<p>
A couple of things about this influx:
<ol>
<li>AOL users still enter their screename when they mean to enter their email address when signing up for things</li>
<li>We're at 22,000 registered users and climbing rapidly</li>
<li>We'll break 100,000 files transferred by the weekend</li>
<li>Average file size transferred: 6.7 megs</li>
<li>People with .nl at the end of their domain name trade a lot of porn</li>
<li>Some of my co-workers use it for work. It's really cool to have them stop me in the kitchen and tell me how much they like it.</li>
<li>If I had a dollar for every person that signed up...</li>
</ol>
