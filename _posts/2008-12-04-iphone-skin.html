<p>This <a href="http://critica.us/product-design/invisual-a-tactile-silicone-case-for-the-apple-iphone/">iPhone/Touch skin</a> is made to work with an App built for the visually impaired. It appears there is no App available at this time, however. For now it's more like a special keyboard with no application. Still a great idea.
