<p><img src="http://notes.torrez.org/images/Picture 7.png" border="0" height="49" width="35" alt="Picture 7.png" align="right" />My friend Omar just moved to the Noe Valley neighborhood in SF where I live. I was downstairs putting my shoes on to get lunch when I remembered he works from home sometimes too. As I started to walk back upstairs to see if he wanted to get food, I remembered his <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">twitter</a> post this morning that he was annoyed with a seat-mate on the CalTrain. He takes the CalTrain into work and so I turned, put my shoes on and got some lunch.</p>
