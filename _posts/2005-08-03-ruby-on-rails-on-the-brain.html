Some day soon, I hope, I'll stop doing this:
</p>
<code>
@campaign = new Campaign.new
</code>
<p>
Otherwise things are starting to really progress rapidly now that I have a better handle on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby On Rails: A Web Framework Based On Ruby">RoR</a>. It's kind of like trying to get a car pushed from a standstill, once you get going it's pretty hard to stop, and sometimes it feels like you're going a bit too fast. I find myself asking questions about problems I see coming up two or three versions from now.
</p>
<p>
There is a difference, of course, between understanding Rails and how everything interacts, and being good with Ruby. I think I waste a little bit more time than normal solving problems with the language. PHP is such a peculiar amalgam of languages that I find myself wanting to solve problems with old methods I learned from not having certain built-in functions. I was always working towards MVC with PHP, so that hasn't been much of a problem.

Also, <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, my new favorite code editor on the planet, is a champ. <a href="http://michaelbuffington.com/">Michael</a> took a peek at the new bundles included (check the Window->Show Bundle Editor item) and blew my mind with all the neat triggers. See <a href="http://macromates.com/blog/archives/2005/07/22/miscellaneous-beta-15-notes/">this post on their blog</a> about some miscellaneous release notes for the recent beta.
