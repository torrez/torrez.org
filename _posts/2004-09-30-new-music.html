<img alt="Mindersalbum" title="Mindersalbum" src="http://torrez.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/mindersalbum.jpg" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /> Well, new to me at least. Been listening to <a href="http://www.theminders.com/">The Minders</a> (hit play in the bottom left corner), <a href="http://www.tullycraftnation.com/Art/twee.mp3">Tullycraft</a> and I finally got the re-release of Jawbreaker's "Dear You" after having only <a href="http://media.torrez.org/mp3/Jawbreaker%20-%20Sluttering%20(May%204th).mp3">Sluttering (May 4th)</a> to go by for a few years now.

I also picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000088E9O/qid=1096588428/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-0560083-4256627?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">Exploding Hearts</a>, which were a band I had only heard about because of a small article in <a href="http://www.explodinghearts.com/Articles/RollingStone.jpg">Rolling Stone Magazine</a> a while back. While picking through the racks at <a href="http://www.amoebamusic.com/html/index.php">Amoeba</a> I remembered the story and figured if they were good enough for Lookout! they were good enough for me. So I bought it and I'm not the least bit disappointed. They probably weren't the greatest band ever, but I'm pretty glad I have this album. It's good.
