title: Best of Dropcash, part 1

<p>
<a href="http://www.dropcash.com/campaign/tomwsmf/packets_over_sunnyside/">This is why</a> I wanted to make Dropcash. Tom of <a href="http://www.wsmf.org/">WSMF</a> is raising money to buy some wireless routers to put on top of some apartments to provide free wireless access as part of <a href="http://www.personaltelco.net/static/index.html">The Personal Telco Project</a>.

Sure, Tom could have thrown up a link directly to PayPal and started collecting money that way, updating the campaign's progress on his site when he could. But now there's a landing page for his campaign so people can keep checking in on the progress in real-time, and that is pretty cool.
