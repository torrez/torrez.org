title: Too Many Games

<p>These two posts (<a href="http://maniacalrage.net/past/2007/10/23/games_are_taking_over_my/">1</a> <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/handkerchief.php">2</a>) are just how I'm feeling these days. There are just <em>too</em> many good games to play. I can't deal.</p>

<p>I <em>canceled</em> my subscription to <a href="http://www.gamefly.com/" title="Netflix for games">Gamefly</a> simply because I have too many games at home already that I want to finish. Just look at <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/xbox360/scores/">MetaCritic's top XBox360 games by score</a>. Jerks!</p>

<p>A couple of years ago everyone was hot about virtual worlds like Second Life or There.com, but it's games that you should be playing! Games both online and offline. It's probably great to walk around a virtual world and wear no clothes (tee hee) or have penises for eyes (seriously?), but give me a world with something to do and some achievements and I'll happily go right to work.</p>

<p>And when I say "something to do" I don't mean <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/07/baby-unicorns-in-sec.html">have sex with a unicorn</a> you crazy perverts.</p>
