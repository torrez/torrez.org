Two years ago <a href="http://torrez.org/archives/2002_06.php">I wrote about Elvis Costello's</a> performance of Radio, Radio on SNL. My friend Benny just found the video for me and I thought I'd offer it here for download.

Also, as a side-note, that bass Bruce Thomas is playing is the same styled p-bass I play. For a brief time in the late 70's Fender started putting black pickguards on their blonde and walnut basses and for a brief moment they looked pretty damn cool. Then the 80's came and they fitted them with white again. To further geek out about that bass, if my memory is correct, when the Beastie Boys repeated this performance on the SNL 25th Anniversary, Adam is playing a late 70's butterscotch blonde p-bass just like Bruce did.</p>
