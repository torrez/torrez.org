Regarding the <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2004/08/dropcash_badges.html">Ozarks Literacy Council badge test below</a>, they have less than 24 hours to raise money to replace that window. More from Dave Adams:
</p>
<blockquote>This particular fundraising need comes at a tough time. OLC receives United Way funds, and to get them, it must halt all fundraising activity during the United Way recruiting period, which begins on Wednesday, September 1 and lasts two months. So we will have to end the fundraising at that time. So if you are considering giving, know that you have to make the donation right away. Thanks again everyone!</blockquote>

If you have a few extra dollars sitting in your PayPal account, consider going to the <a href="http://www.dropcash.com/campaign/ozarksliteracycouncil/ozarks_literacy_council_broken_window/">OLC Campaign</a> and help them out.

ps, breaking $2000 for Dropcash would make me happy too. :)
