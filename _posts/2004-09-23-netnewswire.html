That was quick. I switched back to <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> after just a few hours with it. Nice and light-weight, hooray Ranchero.

<p>
As a plus, because I own a license for NetNewsWire, Ranchero gave me a license for <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> as well. This is my first test of that software.

<strong>Update:</strong> seemed to work okay. I like the integration with NNW and BBEdit, so I'll probably keep using this.
