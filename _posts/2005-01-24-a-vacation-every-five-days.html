title: A Vacation Every Five Days
---
<p>
I took a vacation from the Internet this weekend. I found that a) I receive a tremendous amount of email that builds up after only two days if I'm not there to weed through it, and b) my weekends seem a lot longer when I'm not sitting on the couch with my laptop.

I didn't get to finish a little project I had been working on, but I've found that I really don't care all that much after all.
