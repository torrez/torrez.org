<p>This is a test post from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/r/testpost"><img width="41" height="18" border="0" align="middle" src="http://www.flickr.com/images/flickr_logo_blog.gif" alt="flickr" /></a>, a fancy photo sharing thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the only thing I can post from flickr is the above test post message. Nothing else works. I wanted to show you this picture of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/torrez/15683639/">Uranus.</a> Oh well.</p>
