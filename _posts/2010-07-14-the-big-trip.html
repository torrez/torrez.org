<p>Justin Watt, one of the finest engineers at Federated Media (and one of the best I ever worked with), is headed out on <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2010/07/the-big-adventure/">a trip around the world</a> with his girlfriend Stephanie. </p>

<p>The best part, and something that is typical of Justin and Stephanie's attitudes in life, is they don't really have an end date planned. </p>

<p>While I don't think I ever had the courage to quit my job and set sail around the world, I feel pretty cool to know some people who are actually doing it. I do hope they can blog it all.</p>
