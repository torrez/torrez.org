I'm going to follow <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/07/18/find_me_a_home">Anil's lead</a> and put a call out for something in the Cole Valley/Noe Valley area. Living a block south of Haight has been nice, but if I hear "Yo, bitch, I said 'STEP THE FUCK OFF!'" <em>one more time</em> from this window I'm seriously going to go down there and explain to the gentleman the merits of a respectful, two-way relationship. Or something.

Also: walking + hills = holy fuck.
