<p>...And just like that and I have a little brewery in my apartment.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/torrez/953942977/" title="photo sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1119/953942977_8068fc24c1_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>This weekend I rented a car and loaded up on all my supplies. I planned on brewing when I had some time this week, but I have no patience when it comes to new projects and I started only hours after unpacking the car.</p>

<p>The process took about four and a half hours from heating up my water to getting it in the glass carboy. The next morning I woke up to find an eruption of activity that smelled...well, not so great at 7am, but when I come home from work I sit with it for a few minutes with a bottle of store bought beer and watch the little bubbles percolate. </p>

<p>Now that the blow off has subsided (it foams up and over the top) the smell has gone away. I have five more days of it like this, then I transfer to another container to get the beer off the sediment (hops/used yeast) that's collected at the bottom. After several days in the new container I bottle it, and let it age a bit and build up some carbonation.</p>

<p>This was something of a test run. It had been so long since I brewed anything I was more interested in going through the motions and remembering what I needed to do and when. I have no idea if this beer will be any good&mdash;I assume it will be drinkable&mdash;but once I get a good rythym going I can start focusing on all the things you have to pay attention to to brew excellent beer.</p>
