<p><a href="http://www.thebigwordproject.com">The Big Word Project</a> is like the <a href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Home Page</a> with a clever little twist. Pick a word, if it's available, pay a dollar a letter and have that word linked to your site. It's kind of fun to do. I bought two. </p>
