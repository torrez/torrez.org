<p>My mom would often walk by me watching MTV and would stand for a bit and watch with me. When the video was over she'd ask something like, "What did that mean to you?" or "What do you think that's saying to you?" The time she did that at the end of A-Ha's video was a tense moment that I still remember to this day.</p>
