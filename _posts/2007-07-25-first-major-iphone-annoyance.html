While trying to register on <a href="https://www.translink.org/getTranslinkOrderCardSubmitCardDetails.do">Translink's site</a>, the iPhone <em>conveniently</em> sensed the field was named with "phone" and replaced my keyboard with a number keypad. A number keypad with <em>no dash</em>. A dash that the Translink required on their end to know it was a "real" number.</p>
