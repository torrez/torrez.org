We take giant steps. When you are in love with someone, and trust them, it is amazing how easy the giant steps can be. Let's quit our jobs! We'll sell our cars! Move to San Francisco! Get engaged! Get a giant tattoo on your left arm as your FIRST TATTOO!

Giant! Steps!

This is my best friend I'm going to marry. She's this shining, happy, clever, incredibly talented woman who inspires me to be a better friend. She inspires me to take giant steps. Sometimes just to keep up with her, sometimes because she just believes I can take them.

<p>
And the best part is we always take them together.</p>

<p>Happy Valentine's Day, Amber.</p>
