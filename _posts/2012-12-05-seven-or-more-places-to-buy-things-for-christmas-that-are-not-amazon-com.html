title: Seven Or More Places To Buy Things For Christmas That Are Not Amazon.com
category: Consumerism
---
<p>I did a large amount of my Christmas shopping before our yearly vacation this year. And one thing I tried to do was order from places that weren’t Amazon. I did order a few things from Amazon, but I made an effort to search other places first.</p>

<p>I don’t particularly mind Amazon&#8212;I just think it’s fun to try and support other businesses and manufacturers on the web. Cool?</p>

<li><a href="http://www.jetpens.com/">Jetpens</a> Jetpens has a huge selection of pens and reviews. Only recently after taking a new job that required a bit more sketching and writing did I start really getting particular about which pens I used regularly. In addition to some <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Birdy-Stainless-Steel-Body-Mini-Ballpoint-Pen-0.7-mm-Black-Ink/pd/4747">inexpensive yet durable traveling pens</a>, Jetpens also carries <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Rotring-800-Drafting-Pencil-0.5-mm-Black-Body/pd/6767">gorgeous mechanical pencils</a>,  pencil cases and bags, paper and blank books and assorted office (drool…) supplies.</li>
<li><a href="http://adafruit.com">Adafruit</a> I have to admit I didn’t really appreciate the maker movement until this year. I saw a <a href="http://www.makerbot.com">MakerBot</a> churning away at XOXO and it sparked something in my brain. Then Chris Anderson’s <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2012/11/chris-anderson-why-hes-leaving-digital-diy/3781/">Makers: The New Industrial Revolution</a> was released and now I am irretrievably hooked on the subject. I have a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supermechanical/twine-listen-to-your-world-talk-to-the-internet">Twine</a>, a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>, an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a>, and way too many ideas of stuff I want to make. It feels just like 1998 did for me when the web was this massive, exploding software playground. I don’t think I actually bought gifts from here, but if you are buying gifts for me…<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/975">hint</a>…<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/814">hint</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tonx.org/947b0497">Tonx</a> If you don’t have a Tonx subscription and you love coffee you are missing out on an amazing service. Every two weeks a new, freshly roasted batch sourced from some place in the world is shipped to your door. Included is a small card describing your coffee’s flavors as well as a bit about the place it came from. EVERYONE who loves coffee would appreciate this service.</li>
<li><a href="http://dodocase.com/">Dodocase</a> Two things I want you to know about Dodocase: a couple weeks after my iPad case arrived I dropped and broke the corner. The case is partly made of bamboo and that corner just snapped clean off. Pretty clearly my fault, but I did tweet at them that it had happened in case this was abnormal and they <em>immediately</em> sent me a replacement. I wasn’t expecting it but now I want to recommend them to anyone looking for the type of case Dodocase makes. <br><br>The second thing is that if you have a Kindle Paperwhite you really have to get the Dodocase for it. It sticks onto the case with tape, which one  wouldn’t think is going to be very sturdy, but now after a couple months with it, I think I love my Paperwhite twice as much with the case. Tablet and phone cases are a pretty personal thing, and I don’t know if a Dodocase makes a good gift for someone not expecting it, but if you know someone wants that Moleskine-like look and feel I highly recommend it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.20x200.com">20x200</a> Affordable art shipped to your door. I heard Jen Bekman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKidFYMUXxY">speak at XOXO</a> about the art world’s reluctance to provide the ability to shop by category, price, and color. 20x200 is such a great story about taking an idea, routing around the naysayers, and putting in front of customers. We own a few prints from 20x200 and they are prints I surely would not have thought to buy without finding them on 20x200.</li>
<li><a href="http://killscreendaily.com">Killscreen Magazine</a> Know someone really into video games? No, I mean REALLY into video games? Get them a subscription to Killscreen magazine. I receive the paper edition, but it looks like they have ebooks now.</li>
<li>Assorted things I like: <a href="http://www.makershed.com/Maker_s_Notebook_p/9780596519414.htm">this Maker’s Notebook</a> lays flat, has page numbers and a header on each page you can fill out about which project the page is about. <a href="http://distance.cc">Distance Magazine</a>: “smart essays about design and technology.” <a href="http://topatoco.com">TopatoCo</a>! <a href="http://store.dieselsweeties.com">Diesel Sweeties Store</a>!</li>
