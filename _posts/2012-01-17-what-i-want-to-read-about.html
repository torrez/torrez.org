<p><a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2012/01/backdoor-deals.html">After my post yesterday</a> I received some nice email and question about what exactly I do think a tech site should be covering. I have a lot to say on this, and I don’t have a ton of examples right now, but I thought I’d write the first ones that come to mind here and then just reply with the URL to this post.</p>

<p>In short two things interest me: the first is small teams or businesses that have managed to bootstrap themselves without angel or VC money. There are SO MANY ways to fund a company that knowing someone did it with a product that people actually wanted is so much more valuable to me as a reader. I think one could spend a year chasing down the people who have bootstrapped or <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/glif-iphone-4-tripod-mount-and-stand/">overfunded their idea on Kickstarter</a> and then went on to <a href="http://www.studioneat.com/products/cosmonaut">deliver another great product</a>. A weblog with a hard requirement like that would be a daily read.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://thewirecutter.com">Wirecutter</a> on The Awl network. Did not take funding. A one man operation. Makes money with ads and Amazon referrals. Hell yeah! That’s a great story.</p>

<p>The second thing that interests me is actual emerging tech ideas, not manufactured ones. I am talking about the sorts of people who tinker with APIs and services to come up with a new way to publish or share.</p>

<p>This year I think the big thing will be taking back your data from the cloud. I think owning your own data and having file-level control of your photos and blog posts and personal relationships on your computer is going to become much more popular than it is now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmathai/openphoto-a-photo-service-for-your-s3-or-dropbox-a">OpenPhoto</a> was a Kickstarter project that successfully funded an open-source solution to managing your photos through Dropbox or S3. It was built with $25,000 of supporter’s money. I mean, <a href="http://photos.jordanbrock.com/">look at this</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is a “blog-aware, static site generator” that has been around for over three and a half years. The idea is that you don’t need a centralized blog posting service to generate and host your static files, you can have them generated locally and pushed to a static web server. Quite a few people have been thinking about this for a while now. Brent Simmons has been <a href="http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head">working on one</a> since 2009, Marco Arment just pushed the source to <a href="http://www.marco.org/secondcrack">Second Crack</a> on Github. I just saw <a href="http://spiritofnine.com/posts/2012/01/16/site-rewrite-complete/">a new one yesterday</a> that looks great but is extremely custom and probably won’t be released any time soon, but the need is there.</p>

<p>These “own your content” apps are still in the toothpick and wad of gum stages, but someone is going to get this right and it’s not just going to be a great story but a new way of thinking about how we publish and own our content.</p>

<p>What’s boring: $10 million in funding to make a new Facebook. Yes, you can hire a ton of people and <a href="http://vimeo.com/colorlabs/commercial">make perplexing videos</a> on someone else’s dime for quite a while it seems. I thought the first version of Color was actually cool if not cold and a bit cumbersome, but since then they haven’t done very much worth posting about yet we get new blog posts and profiles about the founder every few months.</p>

<p>All that said, and given I linked to a quote about PandoDaily in the previous post, I also think <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/01/16/dick-costolo-is-right-wikipedias-sopa-blackout-is-a-terrible-idea/">posts like this</a> are absolutely worth discussing. Anyone up for a stop Jimmy Wales protest avatar?</p>
