<p>Oh jeez, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2007/10/05/customer-service-address-book">this is so obvious</a> and brilliant. Put all your credit card, phone, bank, airline, and other customer service numbers in your address book which ultimately end up on your phone if you're syncing.</p>

<p>Here's a bonus tip I do at home with my fire-proof lock box: I leave the key in the lock. If anyone came to steal it they'd just open it, see all I have is a passport and social security card and leave it. Nothing worth stealing in there.</p>
