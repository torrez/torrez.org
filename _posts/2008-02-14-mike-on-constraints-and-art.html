<p>In <a href="http://weblog.muledesign.com/2008/02/choices_are_handcuffs.php">Choices Are Handcuffs</a> Mike talks about how he used constraints to help focus his latest art project.</p>

<p>I love constraints. I create them sometimes just to get a handle on what I need to do. I resolved to not buy one video game or book until I finished every unread book and unfinished video game sitting in my apartment in 2008. I've been doing pretty well so far, and it's forced me to dive into some books and games I had previously given up on.</p>
