title: External Status Blogs

<p>
Here are two external blogs to keep you updated on <a href="http://dropload.blogspot.com/">Dropload</a> and <a href="http://dropcash.blogspot.com/">DropCash</a>.
</p>
<p>
We had a small outage today with DropCash's TypeKey scripts, and now that Dropload has been getting a ton of use it has a lot more issues and needs a place to put updates. Jon at <a href="http://jon.lagparty.org/">LagParty</a> has been taking care of a lot of the site issues and doing support for Dropload, so it just made sense to start a blog to notify users. They also needed to be offsite during server downtime so Blogger was an obvious choice.

<p>
Oh and happy birthday, Blogger.
