<p>I've been loving Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw's video game reviews. If you haven't seen them you should immediately <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/">go there now and watch all of them</a>, or at least his <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/zeropunctuation/1383-Zero-Punctuation-Console-Rundown">console rundown</a>.</p>

<p>So, I was happy to see he also <a href="http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/games.htm">makes games</a>, and his most recent one gets <a href="http://playthisthing.com/5-days-stranger">a good review on Play This Thing</a>. I can't play it because I don't have a Windows PC, but I thought you might like to know.</p>
