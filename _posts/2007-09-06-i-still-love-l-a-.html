<p>Dooce took a trip back to L.A. recently and has <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily_photo/09_06_2007.html">been posting photos from her trip</a>. As much as I enjoy living in San Francisco, walking to the train in the mornings as the sun comes up, or walking back to our apartment after a few glasses of beer without guilt, I will always like L.A. more. </p>

<p>I can't explain it to people who don't love Los Angeles, it's like trying to explain why Macs are superior or Jesus totally kicks ass. As irrational as it seems, it's just better.</p>
