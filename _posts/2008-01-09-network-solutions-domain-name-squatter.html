<p><a href="http://commandline.org.uk/more/squat-for-the-win-2008-01-09-03-36">Nice detective work</a> pointing out Network Solutions' trick of locking up domain names for a few days after you use their search engine (or "whois" from your command-line). found on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">daringfireball</a>.</p>

<p>I've noticed this with a few other registrars and domain search services, but couldn't prove it. Glad to see someone caught NetSol with their pants down.</p>
