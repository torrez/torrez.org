I just rolled through <a href="http://listsofbests.com/list/92/">this list</a> of the top 100 overlooked films compiled by the online film critics society and netflixed a bunch of them.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B00008RH3L/billturner">Miller's Crossing</a> definitely deserves to be at the top of that list. I was on Amazon's DVD waiting list for that one to get released and have watched it almost as much as #17 on that list.

<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0780623223/billturner">Zero Effect</a> written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan's son Jake is a classic movie mystery set in Portland. It's something of an homage to Sherlock Holmes but you don't need to know anything about those stories to get this film. The movie has a weak ending that is a bit of a let down, but the rest of the movie is so good you'll hardly notice. Ryan O'Neil plays his "red-faced, emotional guy" as good as any other film he's been in, and Ben Stiller is a good foil for Bill Pullman. Bill Pullman! This movie made me want to get a little Bill Pullman tattoo on my butt.

The commentary track is also very good. Jake later directed some episodes of "Freaks and Geeks", including the pilot, but nothing else worth noting. His <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0440458/">IMDB page</a> doesn't even show him working on anything at this moment.
