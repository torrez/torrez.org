<p>Two friends at work have started <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=279595523">a unique podcast</a> called <a href="http://whitenoiselounge.com/">White Noise Lounge</a>. </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://whitenoiselounge.com/about/">about page</a>:<br />
<em>We went back and forth like this for a while, cracking each other up with ideas like “white noise radio,” that played nothing but a continuous low hum, all—day—long. The next morning she was still giggling to herself about it. </em></p>

<p>I've been listening to them all morning. It's interesting how the different background noises can affect your mood. The idling Vespa made me anxious, the bridge joints were calming, and the sound of tinkling dishes and silverware was pleasant. </p>

<p>Sometimes life is too quiet, instead of turning on a TV or a distracting radio, why not invite some dishwashers into your house? </p>
