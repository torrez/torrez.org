<p>Sorry I uncircled you on Google+. Hell, I uncircled everyone and closed my account. Boop dee boop!</p>

<p>Facebook was never my thing, and Google+ filled with the 300 or so people I interact with on Twitter + 1,000 or so people I have never talked to (mostly dudes) was really not my thing either. I'm on Twitter. I love Twitter. I don't need anything else to keep up with what people are doing.</p>

<p>It's nice to see Google finally getting a clue about how to make a social media site, but as someone remarked on Twitter, "Twitter and Facebook were indie rock bands that made it big, Google+ is a manufactured boy band."</p>

<p>Plus that anonymity thing is so much bullshit. It's cheating by forcing accountability rather than fostering it.</p>
