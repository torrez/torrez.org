<p>I had an idea a couple weeks ago and so I tweeted about it:</p>

<p><img src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef014e8bd26caf970d-pi" alt="Screen Shot 2011 09 25 at 6 59 10 PM" title="Screen Shot 2011-09-25 at 6.59.10 PM.png" border="0" width="511" height="263" /></p>

<p>Nobody took up the challenge. So after finding a couple hours of my own, and wanting to get better with <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a>, I made it. (Wrote mostly with CoffeeScript because OMG CoffeeScript)</p>

<p><a href="http://laterspam.org/">laterspam.org</a> (note, this is on the most anemic, cheap, virtual machine Amazon offers, it’s not quite ready for heavy use so be gentle.)</p>

<p>It looks <a href="http://mlkshk.com/r/7MOW">something like this</a>.</p>

<p>In my experience there isn’t much of a spam problem on Twitter. Yes, it’s annoying to mention something about your iPad and have a spam bot or two tell you how you can get a free one just by “clicking this URL,” but I feel like that happens once or twice a month at most.</p>

<p>I normally just mark the thing as spam and move on. But the last time it happened I clicked over to see the account’s timeline and saw they had been at it for quite some time. Even tweeting innocuous tweets in between the mention spam which I guessed was to throw off Twitter’s own spam algorithms.</p>

<p>I didn’t make this because I am fed up with Twitter’s spam. I made it because after spending a few weeks now dealing with <a href="http://mlkshk.com/">MLKSHK</a>’s own spam problem I was curious about Twitter’s rate of discovery. For the most part I’m curious how long after I report spam that an account is deactivated. As I got deeper into my spam problem I found myself enjoying figuring out ways to deal with it, how quickly my algorithms caught and removed it, and mostly just because I‘m a sucker for seeing my code automatically take care of admin duties.</p>

<p>So I built <a href="http://laterspam.org/">laterspam.org</a> because I thought people might get a little satisfaction out of marking something as spam and knowing Twitter did something about it.</p>
