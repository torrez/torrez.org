title: NoVIMber Day 4

<p>After a couple days of using MacVim and not exactly liking NERDTree, I installed <a href="https://github.com/alloy/macvim">this fork</a> that provides a very nice Mac-like file browser. </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/alloy/macvim"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef015436bedb08970c-pi" alt="MacVim Alloy Branch" title="MacVim Alloy Branch.png" border="0" width="353" height="255" /></a></p>

<p>I also found out about an OS X application called <a href="http://vicoapp.com/">Vico</a> that attempts to merge the goodness of vim with the look and feel of a typical Cocoa application. It looks very nice, but also $40 so I am going to wait until I’m good with vim before giving the 15-day trial a spin.</p>

<p>Overall I’d say I’m back up to normal productivity, and it feels like every hour I spend with it I discover a new way to to do something.</p>
