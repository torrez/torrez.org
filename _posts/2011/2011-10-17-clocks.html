<p>I’ve been meaning to point to Adam’s new site: <a href="http://decommodify.com/">Decommodify</a>.</p>

<p>He just <a href="http://decommodify.com/the-unbearable-sound-of-alarm-clocks/">posted about his frustrations</a> with his alarm clock. While I don’t use an alarm clock, we do have a clock in our bedroom* that I absolutely love simply because I don’t think about it much.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/torrez/371083043/"><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef014e8c52e39c970d-pi" alt="Clock" title="clock.png" border="0" width="490" height="242" /></a></p>

<p>Right up until I read Adam’s post I forgot that we even have this in our room, yet I look at it several times a day when getting ready to go to work or to bed. It’s my dream clock and I wish I knew how to get more because I would fill my house and office with them.</p>

<p>I joked with Amber the other day that I’d be more of a minimalist if I could just stop being a nostalgist. Every time I sit down to throw stuff out I run into that dumb painting my co-workers got me for that one birthday or a CD that rode with me in my little pickup as I made deliveries in Los Angeles over fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>I didn’t upgrade my iPhone4 to the 4s and very likely won’t. It’s not because I’m attached to this version I’ve carried with me for a while now (it’s actually a replacement for the one I originally purchased). It feels more due to that clock up there. They really got this one right and other than a new camera (this one is fine for pictures of my son) I don’t see a reason. The phone has sort of blended into my life in a way that a faster chip or better camera isn’t going to change much. </p>

<p>I will probably upgrade when this one breaks. I wish I could for that clock.</p>

<p><small>* It appears you can <a href="http://www.dinodirect.com/Red-LED-Plasma-Alarm-Clock.html">purchase one here</a> I’m not 100% sure that is the same, but it looks like it.</small></p>
