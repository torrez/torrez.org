<p>In 2010 I had a project where I <a href="http://radio.torrez.org">only listened to music released in 2010</a> (except for January 2010: I listened to anything released in 2009 because I mean come on…). It was a fun experiment that introduced me to TONS of bands and music that I still listen to now.</p>

<p>The project changed me a bit. I feel like I can point to 2010 as the year I let go of a lot of shitty music in my past and shook loose a lot of the conceptions I had about what I liked.</p>

<p>There was a story today on the NYTimes about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/arts/music/rock-in-2011-hot-chelle-rae-foster-the-people-chevelle.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all">what a shitty year it was for music</a>* but I don’t believe it**. I think it was a shitty year for whatever label-manufactured band that I saw plastered on busses and walls on my way to work, but music is always good. There is always good stuff out there if you look.</p>

<p>To illustrate my point, I am not even kidding, someone just pointed me to an Australian garage band I’d never heard of called “Eddy Current Suppression Ring” on <a href="http://thisismyjam.com">This Is My Jam</a>. Released just this past October:</p>

<p>Isn’t that great?</p>

<p>So yeah, I am doing my music experiment again. This time I’ll blog it here and on <a href="http://thisismyjam.com/">This Is My Jam</a> rather than on a <a href="http://radio.torrez.org">separate weblog</a>. It’s hard. It’s fun. But it reminds me that music is always good if you’re willing to look and not worry if some label’s great hope didn’t materialize. </p>

<p><small>* The worst part is they lead off with the (terrible) return of one of my favorite bands and rhythm sections of <strong>all time</strong>. I saw Sublime play quite a few times in clubs and backyards (nearly 20 years ago!) before they blew it and Brad died. Stupid stupid stupid.</small></p>
