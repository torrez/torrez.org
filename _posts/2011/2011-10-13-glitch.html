<p>I tweeted earlier about Glitch:</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/torrez/status/124542343616528384">http://twitter.com/torrez/status/124542343616528384</a></p>

<p>But I think having 140 characters didn’t give me enough space to fully explain why I am so excited about it. </p>

<p>So go ahead and <a href="http://developer.glitch.com/blog/2011/10/11/glitchifaction-of-an-ios-runner/">read this post</a> and be sure to watch the two videos. The first is a simple iOS app with some physics <strong>completely unattached to Glitch</strong>. It’s just an iOS app probably written with some stock game engine.</p>

<p>The second video is that same, simple game that has been <em>given permission</em>, via OAuth (not unlike you giving permission to a Twitter app to do something with your Twitter time-line), to pull in the player’s face, body and surrounding Glitch-world imagery.</p>

<p>This is incredible!</p>

<p>Lest you think this is some kind of fun hack, remember these are some of the people behind <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/developer">one of the finest APIs</a> ever written. While there have been games that have exposed services and player statuses, I can‘t remember any being this accessible and web friendly. The rest of their developer post goes on to point out how this is just the beginning of what they’re going to add. </p>

<p>This is a big deal!</p>
