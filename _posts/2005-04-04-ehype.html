I try very hard not to believe the Hype. Especially the eHype. When I'm not trying my hardest to not buy into it, I'm buying into it&#8212;hardcore.
</p>
<p>
Take <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a>. I'd heard some great things about it, but having spend the past five years doing nothing but PHP and some Python, I was just getting settled into PHP5+Smarty, doing the MVC thing by hand.
</p>
<p>
I didn't graduate with a CS degree, so a lot of design patterns and concepts have come to me through trial and error. I also read a lot about them and copy them when I see them in open source projects. I am very self-conscious of whatever I write falling into the hands of someone who knows what they're doing, so I try even harder to make things readable and well laid out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this weekend I dove head first into Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I get the Hype. The Hype is warranted. For prototyping and building the simple web tools I like to build, RoR looks to be the thing I always wanted.
</p>
<p>
And Ruby! Ruby is very nice and uncluttered. Yes, it has some peculiar PERL-like "let's stuff everything onto one line" type syntax, but it's nothing that doesn't readily make sense to me after seeing them in action.
</p>
<p>
If you were waiting for someone to tell you, "Yes, try Ruby on Rails" then I am saying it now.
