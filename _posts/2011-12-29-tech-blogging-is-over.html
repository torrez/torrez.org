<p>I’m still working out the kinks here, but I am returning to proper blogging. This isn’t a 2012 thing or an experiment, I am returning to share good stuff with you. I hope you like it.</p>

<p>Dave Winer (!) <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/29/morningCoffeeNotes.html">posted some notes</a> about the year and a response to the “golden age of tech blogging” being over.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the "golden age" of tech blogging over? Jeremiah Owyang <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2011/12/27/end-of-an-era-the-golden-age-of-tech-blogging-is-over/">says</a> it is. I guess it's all about point of view. If you think tech blogging was Mike Arrington and TechCrunch, then yes indeed, it's over. </p>
