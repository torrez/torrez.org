<p>Here is how I would like to define relationship permissions to content on social networking sites like Flickr.</p>

<p><img src="http://torrez.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bfc1653ef010536a609fe970c-pi" alt="relationships.png" border="0" width="400" height="150" /></p>

<p>In the first image I am assigning someone to a particular friend group. In the second image I'm telling the system which outer-most friend group I want to be able to access newly added content. </p>

<p>Something about selecting cones of permissions this way interests me. I would even like to use it to define severity of bugs, immediacy of problems, or even estimating the magnitude of difficulty something might have. </p>

<p><strong>Oh neat</strong>: <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/001138.html">Caterina, one of the founders of Flickr, responds</a> with some background on this idea and how it is not really a good way to define permissions. Nice to see that someone actually did it. I still think it'd be a nice UI feature for selecting magnitudes.</p>
