<p><em>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think
"I know, I'll use regular expressions."   Now they have two problems. </em><br />
--usually attributed to jwz in comp.lang.emacs</p>

<p>I had seen jwz's quote a few times, it's a very clever, and in the past week as I've been playing with a particularly nasty regex in Erlang I keep muttering to myself variations&mdash;"now I have <strong>nine</strong> problems" for example.</p>

<p>Today I threw the quote into Google and <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">found this post over a year old</a> by the guy who taught me regular expressions, the author of <a href="http://regex.info/">Mastering Regular Expressions</a> Jeffrey Friedl. </p>

<p>In his post he tracks down the original quote and possible origins. Apparently it was recently on Reddit, and jwz himself makes an appearance in the comments.</p>
