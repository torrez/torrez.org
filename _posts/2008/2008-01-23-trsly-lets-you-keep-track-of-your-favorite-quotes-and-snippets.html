<p>The other day <a href="http://notes.torrez.org/2008/01/its-like-ffffou.html">I posted about how I wanted a ffffound.com for quotes</a>. Finn in the comments pointed out <a href="http://trsly.com">trsly.com</a> which is pretty much what I was talking about, although I feel a little self-conscious that <a href="http://trsly.com/users/torrez/highlighted">my quotes</a> are a bit unlike others. (I think insane web comments and racist bigoted news articles on CNN are notable.)</p>

<p>You have to admit, <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/01/preview-penny-a.html#comment-97768860">this comment</a> is very likely the comment of the year.</p>
