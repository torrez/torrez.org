<p>Of course, today we just signed up to live in this City for a few more years. We found a place in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_District%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California">Outer Sunset</a> which sounds a lot like saying we're moving to one of Saturn's Outer Moons&#8212;and that is not far from the truth&#8212;but we do get our own place with a yard and can still stay in San Francisco. </p>
