<p>Two things made me very happy to discover today:</p>

<p><a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/">Garrett Murray</a> started a new Flickr group called <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/mydayyesterday/pool/">"My Day, Yesterday"</a> for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/garrettmurray/2927448272/">this video</a>. Dean Allen joined him with <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/deanallen/2929207103/">this one</a>. Let's have more of this!</p>

<p><a href="http://waxy.org/">Andy Baio</a> and <a href="http://joshua.schachter.org/">Joshua Schachter</a> created <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/10/memeorandum_colors/">Memeorandum Colors</a> to help identify conservative/liberal bias (and shades in between) in their linking activity. If you're simply interested in running it <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/10/memeorandum_colors/">head over and download now</a>.</p>

<p>If you're into the geeky side of how it works, Andy includes it at the bottom. Today I learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</a>. Sweet.</p>
