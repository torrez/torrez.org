<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/03/kottkeorg-is-ten-years-old-today">Jason celebrates 10 years</a> of running a very popular, personal weblog. I began reading him somewhere in the 98/99 year and never stopped. I copied him by registering my last name + .org and starting my own weblog. </p>

<p>Other things I know about Jason: Our birthdays are exactly one year apart (he's younger). We have the same number of letters in our first AND last names. Those are things I know about Jason. </p>
