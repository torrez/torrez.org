<p>I've been so busy the past two weeks I have pretty much lost all contact with Google Reader. Lots of good stuff coming up, I'll tell you about it when you're older. For now here's an update:</p>

<p>I bought a reissue of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H2CGIetAT4">my favorite skateboard</a> from when I was a teenager. Amber helped me get around the loophole of not buying video games in 2008 by buying me <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/professorlayton">Professor Layton and the Curious Village</a>. My good friend Mat Honan <a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2008/02/my-new-bicycle.html">became an Internet celebrity</a> for creating <a href="http://www.barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com/">Barack Obama Is Your New Bicycle</a>. </p>

<p>Plus it's been raining all week and I love rain so I'm particularly happy these days. Tonight I'm going to scan my old skate zines. </p>
