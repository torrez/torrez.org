<p>Programmer font surveys show up every couple of months. <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/work/FontSurvey.aspx">This one is pretty complete</a>. I had been using <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/index.html">Dina</a> for a while, and before that <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>. Recently I installed <a href="http://damieng.com/blog/2007/11/14/droid-sans-mono-great-coding-font">Droid</a> for no reason other than it came from Google  and it was free.</p>

<p>In productivity talks Merlin Mann refers to things like this as fiddling with your work environment as a form procrastination and he's right. Any monospaced font would produce perfectly fine code—but did you see that <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/work/FontSurvey/Ti92PluspcCT11.png">Ti92Pluspc</a>? So nice. Installing it now…</p>
