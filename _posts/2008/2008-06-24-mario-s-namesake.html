<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario">Wikipedia says Mario</a> (of Nintendo fame) is named after a one-time landlord of Nintendo of America's warehouses Mario Segali. Since no photo exists of Mr. Segali, IGN decided to play a joke by inserting <a href="http://blogs.ign.com/Peer-IGN/2008/06/16/93057/">a photo</a> of an IGN staffer into the <a href="http://blogs.ign.com/Indices/Blogs/Channels/ign/mario_segali/919348/">entry for Mr. Segali</a> in their gamer database. </p>

<p><a href="http://gonintendo.com/?p=45016">That joke photo is now featured on the pages</a> of a recent issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly">EGM</a>).</p>
