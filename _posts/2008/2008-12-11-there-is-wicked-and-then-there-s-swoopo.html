<p>There are some <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">wicked ideas</a>, and then there are some truly wicked ideas. <a href="http://www.swoopo.com/">Swoopo</a> is about the most wicked I've come across in a while. It takes a few minutes to understand what's going on, but when you do you can't believe it's really happening. </p>

<p>I'll blow your mind even more: <a href="http://www.swoopo.com/auction/300-freebids-voucher/129189.html">a current auction for $225 worth of "bids"</a> is currently at $480. These are bids you can buy on the site for $225. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoopo">Wikipedia explanation is probably the best one</a>.</p>
