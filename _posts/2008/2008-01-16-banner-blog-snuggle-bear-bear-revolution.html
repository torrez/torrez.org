<p><a href="http://www.bannerblog.com.au/2008/01/snuggle_bear_bear_revolution.php">Snuggle Bear Bear Revolution</a> is a banner ad that mimics Dance Dance Revolution. I love reading <a href="http://www.bannerblog.com.au/">Banner Blog</a> but I am not sure if it's because I've worked with and around banner ads for almost 10 years or because they showcase the intense amount of creativity and work it can sometimes take to make an effective banner ad. </p>

<p>Either way they're a great example of being creative within constraints, and that's interesting to me.</p>
