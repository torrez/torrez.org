<p>Kevin Kelly's eBook called <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/002538.php">200 Documentaries You Must See Before You Die</a> is now free for download. Kevin is using some kind of Yahoo Ad call in the new Adobe Reader. If you have an older version of Adobe Reader or use Apple's preview tool you're not going to see the ads&#8212;but you can still read the book for free.</p>
