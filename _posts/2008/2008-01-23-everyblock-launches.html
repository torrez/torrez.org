<p>I'm very excited to see that <a href="http://blog.everyblock.com/2008/jan/23/launch/">Everyblock launched today</a>. It's local news aggregated from a number of sources like Yelp, Craigslist, Flickr, and even data from the local city government. <a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=2&amp;aid=136307">Here's an interview with Adrian Holovaty at Poynter</a>.</p>

<p>Also: score another point for a Django powered site.</p>
