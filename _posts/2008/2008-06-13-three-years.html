<p>Today is my third anniversary at <a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/">Federated Media</a>. Saying "three years" sounds so short, I almost feel a little silly mentioning it, but it also nearly marks the date FM was born (June 1, 2005) so I figured it's worth pointing out. </p>

<p>I highly recommend everyone do this at some point. Quit your stupid job and spend a couple of years not just working someplace but working on something you really care about. Why not be someplace you want to be every day? Life's too short to wonder if it's worth the risk. </p>

<p>Of course, the other bonus is I get to yell at people "I've been here longer than you!" and it's always true! </p>

<p><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20080610005461&amp;newsLang=en">We just announced a product</a> I am really excited about. We're doing something that builds off our three years of experience and knowledge, and gives advertisers, publishers, and readers more than just a typical web campaign. That's something FM has always tried to do. Don't just run banner ads, pay attention, listen, and you'll make a better product or service. </p>

<p>Oh and <strong><a href="http://federatedmedia.net/about/jobs/#phpdeveloper">we're hiring</a></strong>. Come work in San Francisco and you get to own projects like the CM Toolbox, our forecasting engine, publishing tools, you get to help our publishers, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andrewyang/2315379018/">BBQ</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/justinsomnia/2468467818/">attend outdoor hula hoop</a> meetings (no laptops allowed!), <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/justinsomnia/2496694216/in/photostream/">jump in the bay</a>,  and best of all work with a lot of really caring people who work really fucking hard to make everyone happy. That's what I love most about this place: everyone here cares a lot about FM and those who work with us. </p>

<p>This is exactly the place I want to be every day.</p>
