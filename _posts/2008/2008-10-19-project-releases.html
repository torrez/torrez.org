<p>Two projects released this weekend that are pretty cool if not a bit nerdy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer.com</a> solves the problem of turning a list of MP3s (found on the web or your own) into an RSS feed for people to subscribe to. Excellent story behind the name, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://domai.nr/">Domai.nr</a> helps you identify more creative ways to get the domain name you want by showing you how you can use the other less known TLDs out there.</p>
