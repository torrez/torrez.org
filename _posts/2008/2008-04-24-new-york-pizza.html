Seriously, there is no good pizza in San Francisco. Whenever I go to NY I manage to get at least one slice of pizza from a random shop, and it's better than any pizza I've ever had in California. </p>

<p>If you think you know, please leave me a comment. You should know that I have been to Delfina, Arinell's, Little Star, and A16. (SF does make a god damn good burger though.)</p>
