<p>What an eventful week! I feel like talking about it. </p>

<p>First <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/10/MNDS102IIM.DTL&amp;hw=torch&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000">the torch thing</a> here in SF. Two interesting things came out of that: my Twitter friends who were near the torch kept me updated throughout the day on what was going on, and second, <a href="http://twitter.com/gknauss/statuses/786115640">Greg Knauss summed it up nicely</a>. </p>

<p>Then there's Flickr video! What a bunch of <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/no_video/pool/">hoo-ha</a> about nothing. It seems a large group of people think Flickr is going to turn into YouTube&#8212;whatever that means. Anyway, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/merlin/2400535838/">here is why Flickr is no YouTube</a>. Eleanor is easily the face that sold a thousand <a href="http://www.theflip.com/products_flip_ultra.shtml">Flips</a> (mine arrives today!).</p>

<p>Per my New Year's Resolution: I still haven't bought a single book. I only bought one CD in an emergency situation where I had to drive 600 miles and forgot to burn a CD-R. No DVDs. No video games. </p>
