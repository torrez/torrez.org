<p>The last couple of days I've been setting up my laptop while I work. As I've needed apps I've downloaded them. I think it's neat to see <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/torrez/2314766985/">which ones I really need</a> to do what I do. </p>

<p>It doesn't include iWork, the XCode tools, or some PHP modules, but that's most of it.</p>
