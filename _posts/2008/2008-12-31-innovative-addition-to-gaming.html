<p>Dear friends who do not play games, I think this link I'm going to share is especially good for you to look at. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=2048">It's a short talk about video games and an innovative way to make gaming more accessible to people who think they are not good at games.</a> (Unfortunately the game he focuses on <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/482-Prince-of-Persia">gets panned by Yahtzee</a>)</p>

<p>I've always wished my old games had a walkthrough option, where the game just starts playing itself and maybe you could jump in at some point. Especially during the grinding that happens as filler to the actual story.  Someone could breathe new life into those old games if there was a pre-loader that would do this for any game sitting on my shelf.</p>
