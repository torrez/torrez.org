<p>There are very few games I would say I consciously wait for. I tend to make my decisions about games after they've been released, when I know I can walk down to the store and get it. The last time I think I really stressed about a release date was back when we used to scan .plan files of our favorite developers and designers.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_%28video_game%29">Braid</a> is a game I am waiting for. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow">Jonathan Blow</a> has been hinting on <a href="http://braid-game.com/news/">his weblog</a> that the game is really close, but can't announce the release date due to some XBLA rule. He did mention, and so I will too, that <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/17/castle-crashers-galaga-legions-more-on-xbla-in-4-6-weeks/">this post on Joystiq</a> gives some idea of the time frame. [psst, 4-6 weeks]</p>

<p>If you're like me and have very few games you get excited about these days, <a href="http://braid-game.com/news/?p=220">check out Braid</a>.</p>
