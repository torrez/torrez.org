<p><a href="http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2008/02/15/tweet-sheet/">Get Satisfaction points to a Tweet Sheet</a> to help you remember <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> commands. This idea is cool, but also reminds me of the days of keyboard overlays and dongles and sitting in computer class writing macros to convert letters into ASCII art. (HEY OLD MAN, TELL ME ABOUT FLOPPIES AGAIN!!!)</p>
