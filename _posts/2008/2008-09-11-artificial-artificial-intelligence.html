<p>For some reason I finally started poking around in Amazon's <a href="http://www.mturk.com/mturk/checkrecognition">Mechanical Turk</a> last week. It figures Andy'd be way ahead of me and used mturk for his latest project <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/09/girl_turk/">Girl Turk</a>. </p>

<p>Andy also links to this survey done (on mturk of course) asking why the <a href="http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2008/03/why-people-participate-on-mechanical.html">turkers turk</a>. I read all of the responses (the whole time visualizing myself getting paid for each of those tasks) and there seems to be a general theme running: people do it because they want to kill time and they like seeing the money accumulate. I wish the surveyor would have asked how much people make on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>Seeing Andy's experiment go so well, performing a few HITS mysefl, and reading these responses, I'm suddenly completely fascinated with the system. </p>
