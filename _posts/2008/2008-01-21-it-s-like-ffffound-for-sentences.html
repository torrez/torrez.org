<p>I really wish there was a <a href="http://ffffound.com/">ffffound.com</a> for sentences. I guess that's called a weblog. Anyway, here are two that I wanted to note this weekend:</p>

<p>Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Day">Martin Luther King Day</a> page on South Carolina's May 2000 adoption of MLK day as a state holiday: "Prior to this, employees could choose between celebrating Martin Luther King Day or one of three confederate holidays."</p>

<p>From Mark Pilgrim's book "<a href="http://diveintopython.org/object_oriented_framework/private_functions.html">Dive into Python</a>" on the subject of private functions: "Acknowledge that this is interesting, but promise to never, ever do it in real code."</p>

<p>In case you were ever considering learning Python, I cannot recommend Mark's book enough.</p>
