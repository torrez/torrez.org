<p><a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/culture/movies/netflix-usage.html">Nelson figures out his Netflix usage means he's paying about $11 a disc</a>. I calculated mine over four years and it comes in at just over $2 a disc&#8212;that's just about what it'd cost me if I rented from my local store.</p>

<p>An interesting calculation would be to see how many discs I've actually watched. I'm very good at sending back what I won't watch.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://www.netflix.com/ReturnedRentals">You can find out how many discs you've returned here</a>] (this is screaming for a proper analyzation script, of course.)</p>
