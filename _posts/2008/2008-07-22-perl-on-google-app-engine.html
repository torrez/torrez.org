title: Perl on Google App Engine

<p>I've been playing around with the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> for the past few weeks. I threw a simple Django app [<a href="http://c-o-l-o-r.net/">http://c-o-l-o-r.net/</a>] up there to test out how the deployment tools worked and found them to be really nice. And if it were a popular app the usage reporting tools look like they'd be just as cool.</p>

<p><a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2388824.html">Brad Fitzpatrick just announced</a> he and a few other Perl hackers are using their 20% Google time to create a Perl version of the GAE with no promises from the GAE team that it will be included. But if you're a Perl hacker looking for a project to contribute to, that seems like a really good one.</p>
