<p>Coming out of weblog retirement (almost one month!) to point to <a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2008/09/02/whatever-happened-to-availabot/">Availabot</a>. Availabot is: <em>a physical representation of presence in instant messenger applications, which means Availabot plugs into your computer by USB, stands to attention when your chat buddy comes online, and falls down when they go away.</em></p>

<p>I still want a USB enabled telegraph.</p>
