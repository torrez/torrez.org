<p>Derek Powazek just launched <a href="http://pixish.com/">Pixish</a> a site for creating or fulfilling visual requests. Think <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a> for images. Excellent idea, really excellent execution.  </p>

<p>It's about time that Powazek got off his butt and did something, I mean, it's been almost a week since <a href="http://fray.com/">his other project</a> shipped its first issue.</p>
