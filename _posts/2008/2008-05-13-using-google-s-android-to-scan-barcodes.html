<p>A dream longtime coming: <a href="http://scan.jsharkey.org/">the ability to use your phone's camera to scan barcodes</a> and then scrape all kinds of APIs to deliver data about the product. Be sure and watch the video demo.</p>

<p>It's interesting to me that the APIs he scrapes for data aren't Google's. I was shocked to find out that Google's replacement for their excellent Search API was a very light-weight <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/">AJAX search widget</a> last month. I am hoping Google releases the real Search API at their developer conference this month.</p>
