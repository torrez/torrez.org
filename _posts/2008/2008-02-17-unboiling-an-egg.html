<p>This week <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/02/15051.html">Jason linked to an article</a> which claimed it was possible to "unboil" an egg by unrolling the protein molecules (yuck). At work we all turned around in our seats, argued about it for a bit and then went back to work. Agreeing that even if it was possible we wouldn't want to eat it.</p>
