<p>Watch as Robert Reed, the man who played Mike Brady on the "Brady Bunch", <a href="http://jonrowe.blogspot.com/2004/11/my-sense-of-humor-my-best-friend-david.html">makes an impassioned, cogent argument</a> about why he would not be in the last episode of the series. It's both very funny to read and sad to consider how neurotic and tortured he must have been playing Mike. found on the <a href="http://www.damnhellasskings.com/" title="We're gonna live like kings...">Damn Hell Ass Kings</a></p>
