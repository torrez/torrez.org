I'm just as confused as him why people are so upset about the firewire port and lack of access&#8212;that's the best part! The Air is exactly the computer I want to have around the house to code up an idea, read a book, watch a TV show, send mail, and check in on my feeds. Heck, I can even sit in bed (like I'm doing right now) in the dark and actually see the keys! That's an improvement over this hot, heavy, snarling Macbook. </p>

<p>Lighter, thinner, quieter, cooler, simpler...these are good things.</p>
