<p>I've been pretty quiet lately due to moving and work, but when I heard that George Carlin had died it reminded me of an observation of his that pops into my head a lot in life:</p>

<p>"Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?"</p>
