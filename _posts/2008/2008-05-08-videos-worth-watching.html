<p><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/979938/">This HD time-lapse of a Cinco de Mayo carnival</a> is gorgeously synched to music. Reminds me of my friend <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/andrewyang/2400900223/">Andy's clam-bake</a>. They are both very artfully done. twittered by <a href="http://twitter.com/brownpau/statuses/806668269">brownpau</a></p>

<p>On the other side of the scale is this soundless <a href="http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-20179">video of people lined-up</a> for hours to buy a 23-cent pizza.</p>

<p>Both videos are terribly fascinating to me, for different reasons of course.</p>
