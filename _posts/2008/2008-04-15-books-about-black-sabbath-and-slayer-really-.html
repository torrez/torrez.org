<p>This whole vow of booklessness I've taken on this year is getting harder and harder. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33⅓">33⅓ Series</a> is killing me.</p>

<p>First <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Sabbaths-Master-Reality-33/dp/0826428991/">John Darnielle writing about Black Sabbath's "Master of Reality"</a>.</p>

<p>Next there's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slayers-Reign-Blood-33-3/dp/0826429092/">Slayer's "Reign in Blood"</a> that was to be released today. </p>

<p>Sigh...<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neutral-Milk-Hotels-Aeroplane-Over/dp/082641690X/">In The Aeroplane Over the Sea</a>.</p>
