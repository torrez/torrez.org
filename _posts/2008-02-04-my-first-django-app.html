title: My First Django App

<p>My <a href="http://c-o-l-o-r.net/">first Django app</a> has no real use other than it's terribly pleasing to click that random link (well it is for me). Does anyone really need to bookmark a color? I don't know, but <a href="http://c-o-l-o-r.net/f40093">now</a> <a href="http://c-o-l-o-r.net/f2050e">you</a> <a href="http://c-o-l-o-r.net/8c60be">can</a>.</p>

<p>I do attempt to determine if the text color needs to be <a href="http://c-o-l-o-r.net/c51894">white</a> or <a href="http://c-o-l-o-r.net/fafca2">black</a> but other than that it's pretty dumb. I was just pleased to have a completely senseless idea and get it up and live within a few hours with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>. </p>

<p>I'm in the middle of creating a specialized CMS for <a href="http://www.weheartprints.com/">Amber's print site</a> in Django. Whenever I'm working on a project of that size, and in a new framework, I like to make simple little projects to test ideas. In this case I wanted to see how Django handled load, errors, and how to get mod_python and Django working correctly in a production environment. </p>

<p>Plus also I kind of liked the idea of owning a Google result for a hex color. </p>
