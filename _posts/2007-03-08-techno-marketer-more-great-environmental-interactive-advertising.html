Why I love working at and with the people of FM can be summed up in this one post.

Our sales people get it and work really hard to give advertisers that kind of custom touch for the authors so everyone wins. It's why I think I've been involved with advertising and marketing for ten years now, I know people can do it right and I always wanted to help them do it right with what I'm good at.

Also, this weekend someone at FM (I have a Yahoo pipe of all FM employee blogs) posted about a parenting blog (I can't find it right now because Google Reader doesn't have search--WTF?) who said the income from their blog was equivalent to a part-time job that they would have had to take and be away from their child. As soon as I find the link I'll update. That was a really neat thing to read.
