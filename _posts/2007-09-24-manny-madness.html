<p>I spent about an hour last night trying to perform a combo in <a href="http://skate.ea.com/">skate.</a> called "Manny Madness". A whole hour! I'd only put up with a skateboarding game for an hour like that, just as I did back when I used to actually skate. I'd spend hours trying one trick and sometimes days until I was able to do it, once I figured it out then I'd spend another couple of days trying to tweak it out in some way.</p>

<p>Amber was cheering me on when I finally did it: ollie from an odd angled ramp onto a box, manual across the narrow box, ollie a gap, and then manual across a second box to the end. </p>

<p>In case anyone else is searching how to do it here are three tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Practice ollie-to-manuals to ollie-to-manuals on flat land until they're so dialed it's second nature.</li>
<li>Don't accept the default start location, reposition yourself a bit to the left and further back to get speed and an angle. Drop a session marker so you can restart there over and over.</li>
<li>Try to land as straight as possible to maintain speed. The hardest part about doing this trick is doing the second ollie to manual. It helps to be going fast and straight when you land.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should also practice the trick a few times without the manuals just to get the right angle.</p>
