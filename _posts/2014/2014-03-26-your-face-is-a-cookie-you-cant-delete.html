<p>I have been working on an iOS app that uses iBeacons extensively. I can’t say much about it but because I have been thinking a lot about these unique identifiers (UUIDs) walking around in the real world my brain has been thinking about how these are like browser cookies you wear.</p>

<p>Your Fitbit’s Bluetooth Low Energy UUID is a cookie. Your <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/photos-just-got-more-social">face</a> is a cookie. Your <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/02/04/nymi-armband-bitcoin-wallet/">heartbeat</a> is a cookie. Your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_recognition">eyeball</a> is a cookie. Your phone’s <a href="http://www.density.io/">digital footprint</a> is a cookie.</p>

<p>Some of these cookies you can change. Others are obviously permanent. It goes without saying that to have a database of these “cookies” is valuable. To be able to bridge a gap between your face in friend’s photo and your arrival at a store is going to be a real thing that we will experience soon.</p>

<p>Having spent 5 years at an ad network, hell, just running <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a> is enough to open one’s eyes at the massive amounts of time and money put into setting and retrieving cookies in your browser to build a profile of you.</p>

<p>When that exact hand-mixer you were reading about this weekend shows up as an ad on the NYTimes it seems coincidental and maybe a little creepy but OK. When future store employees greet you by name or you receive an un-acknowledged discount because you’re a valued customer it’s probably going to feel just as creepy but OK. My guess is people won’t really mind it.</p>
