<p>It’s been over a month since I left Tugboat Yards. Since I left I have been spending time catching up on stuff I needed to do and have been wanting to do. One of those things was to sit down with Xcode and take a real stab at learning iOS.</p>
<p>Here are things I learned. They very well might be wrong, but I am so excited about finally making iOS apps that I felt like sharing what I’ve figured out.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>You don’t have to use Interface Builder!</strong> I think I knew this was possible, but I assumed it was the old way of doing things and all new apps were using IB and Storyboards. I like learning what’s under the hood and so I was pleased to find out building an iOS app by declaring your own view controllers and UI elements in code was a perfectly sane thing to do. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ARC is a godsend.</strong> I started programming in C and later C++ so I understand how pointers work, but I also spent the last 15 years writing PHP and Python so I haven’t had to worry as much about memory allocation. While ARC doesn’t mean I can completely forget about it, it was much easier to get started. (Related: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6260256/what-kind-of-leaks-does-automatic-reference-counting-in-objective-c-not-prevent/6388601">What kind of leaks does automatic reference counting in Objective-C not prevent or minimize</a>?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Default iOS 7 UI is actually pretty terrible.</strong> When the first iOS 7 apps started appearing on my phone I liked them. A lot of people were complaining about the new look of iOS 7 but I didn’t understand the hate. All the apps I used looked good and (outside of the new keyboard) I liked it. Now that I am using the default widgets I am understanding why people dislike it so much. It turned out I liked them because the developers of the apps I used had spent a lot of time making sure they looked good.
<br><br>I’ve built apps for OS X and Windows and as a non-designer the most comforting thing about making stuff for those operating systems is that the default elements can stand on their own without extra styling. A default button in iOS 7 is simply a non-bordered rectangle with a label. <a href="https://twitter.com/torrez/status/434036976967110656">The first app I made</a> I felt compelled to point out the button was a button because I hadn’t yet learned how to override that style to make it more obvious. Ugh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The documentation is amazing.</strong> Once you get your head around how to layout an MVC app and the basics of Objective-C the documentation becomes your best friend. I am so used to searching the web for documentation on libraries and services that having it built into my editor and being so easy to use is a whole new world to me. IDEs: Who knew?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re a web developer who has wanted to get into iOS I think now is a good time. I am only a week in so I could be wrong about everything I wrote above, but it was how I was finally able to feel like I could start making things in iOS. </p>
<p>And if you want you can start the way I did by creating an Empty Application, instantiating a UIViewController, and setting it as your window’s root view controller. No Interface Builder required! I wish more beginning iOS tutorials started this way.</p>
