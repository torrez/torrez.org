<p>Okay, I had no intention of buying <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/kanelynchdeadmen/index.html">Kane &amp; Lynch</a>, but after seeing <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/11/05/what-i-do/">Michael's post about working on it</a>, and the accompanying video I think I'm going to pick it up.</p>

<p>Some day, when I have the time, I would like to work on a game with a large group of people. I wouldn't mind just being a cog. I think the experience would be very satisfying. It's just on my list of things I'd love to do some time in my life.</p>
